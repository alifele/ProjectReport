  abstract  = {It has been hypothesized that topological structures of biological transport networks are consequences of energy optimization. Motivated by experimental observation, we propose that adaptation dynamics may underlie this optimization. In contrast to the global nature of optimization, our adaptation dynamics responds only to local information and can naturally incorporate fluctuations in flow distributions. The adaptation dynamics minimizes the global energy consumption to produce optimal networks, which may possess hierarchical loop structures in the presence of strong fluctuations in flow distribution. We further show that there may exist a new phase transition as there is a critical open probability of sinks, above which there are only trees for network structures whereas below which loops begin to emerge.},

  abstract  = {We analyze the structure of networks minimizing the global resistance to flow (or dissipative energy) with respect to two different constraints: fixed total channel volume and fixed total channel surface area. First, we show that channels must be straight and have uniform cross-sectional areas in such optimal networks. We then establish a relation between the cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction. Indeed, this relation is a generalization of Murray’s law, originally established in the context of local optimization. We establish a relation too between angles and cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction, which can be represented as a vectorial force balance equation, where the force weight depends on the channel cross-sectional area. A scaling law between the minimal resistance value and the total volume or surface area value is also derived from the analysis. Furthermore, we show that no more than three or four channels meet at each junction of optimal bidimensional networks, depending on the flow profile (e.g., Poiseuille-like or pluglike) and the considered constraint (fixed volume or surface area). In particular, we show that sources are directly connected to wells, without intermediate junctions, for minimal resistance networks preserving the total channel volume in case of plug flow regime. Finally, all these results are compared with the structure of natural networks.},

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4745 (2000)]. An explicit scaling relation between the currents and the corresponding conductances is derived, proving the potential flow nature of the latter. Varying a unique parameter, the topology of the optimized networks shows a transition from a tree topology to a very redundant structure with loops; the transition corresponds to a discontinuity in the slope of the power dissipation.},

  abstract  = {Abstract: Vascular networks are dynamic structures, adapting to changing conditions by structural remodelling of vessel diameters and by growth of new vessels and regression of existing vessels. The vast number of blood vessels in the circulatory system, more than 109, implies that vessels’ arrangement and structure are not under individual genetic control but emerge as a result of generic responses of each segment to the various stimuli that it experiences. To obtain insight into the types of response that are needed, a network-oriented approach has been used, in which theoretical models are used to simulate structural adaptation in vascular networks, and the results are compared with experimental observations. With regard to the structural control of vessel diameters, this approach shows that responses to both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli are needed for the formation of functionally adequate and efficient network structures. Furthermore, information transfer in both upstream and downstream directions is essential for balancing flows between long and short flow pathways. Otherwise, functional shunting occurs, that is, short pathways become enlarged and flow bypasses longer pathways. Information transfer in the upstream direction is achieved by conducted responses communicated along vessel walls. Simulations of structural adaptation in tumour microvascular networks indicate that impaired vascular communication, resulting in functional shunting, may be an important factor causing the dysfunctional microcirculation and local hypoxia typically observed in tumours. Anti-angiogenic treatment of tumours may restore vascular communication and thereby improve or normalize flow distribution in tumour vasculature.},

  abstract = {Physarum polycephalum is a single-celled, multi-nucleated slime mold whose body constitutes a network of veins. As it explores its environment, it adapts and optimizes its network to external stimuli. It has been shown to exhibit complex behavior, like solving mazes, finding the shortest path, and creating cost-efficient and robust networks. Several models have been developed to attempt to mimic its network's adaptation in order to try to understand the mechanisms behind its behavior as well as to be able to create efficient networks. This thesis aims to study a recently developed, physically-consistent model based on adaptive Hagen-Poiseuille flows on graphs, determining the properties of the trees it creates and probing them to understand if they are realistic and consistent with experiment. It also intends to use said model to produce short and efficient networks, applying it to a real-life transport network example. We have found that the model is able to create networks that are consistent with biological networks: they follow Murray's law at steady state, exhibit structures similar to Physarum's networks, and even present peristalsis (oscillations of the vein radii) and shuttle streaming (the back-and-forth movement of cytoplasm inside Physarum's veins) in some parts of the networks. We have also used the model paired with different stochastic algorithms to produce efficient, short, and cost-efficient networks; when compared to a real transport network, mainland Portugal's railway system, all algorithms proved to be more efficient and some proved to be more cost-efficient.},

  abstract = {Physarum polycephalum is an acellular slime mould that grows as a highly adaptive network of veins filled with protoplasm. As it forages, Physarum dynamically rearranges its network structure as a response to local stimuli information, optimising the connection between food sources. This high-level behaviour was already exploited to solve numerous optimisation problems. We develop a flow-based model for the adaptive network formation of Physarum, which solves some inconsistencies of previous models. We first derive a general class of equations describing the adaptation and flow dynamics of a static network comprised of elastic channels filled with an incompressible fluid undergoing a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. An explicit form of the model is obtained by minimising the total power dissipated by the network. Considering a more general functional form of the adaptive equations, a phase transition in the system is also found. The model is used for maze-solving and to build efficient and resilient networks in an arena mimicking mainland Portugal. By comparing the resulting networks with the real Portuguese railway system, we found that the model produced networks with a better overall performance when considering fluctuations in the network flows. Finally, the adaption model is extended to incorporate the network growth in the presence of multiple food sources. The coupling of both processes produces networks with similar traits to several network systems found in nature. We found that when the food sources operate alternately, the model can replicate the direct connections between the food sources observed in Physarum.},

              Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold
              Physarum polycephalum
              forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks—in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

Often, the relevant optimization functional is nonconvex and characterized by many local extrema. In general, finding the global, or nearly global optimum is difficult. In biological systems, it is believed that such an optimal state is slowly achieved through natural selection. However, general coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback rules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency, local minima. In this work we show how the growth of the underlying tissue, coupled to the dynamical equations for network development, can drive the system to a dramatically improved optimal state. This general model provides a surprisingly simple explanation for the appearance of highly optimized transport networks in biology such as leaf and animal vasculature.},
