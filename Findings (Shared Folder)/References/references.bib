  abstract = {The “protein folding problem” consists of three closely related puzzles: (a) What is the folding code? (b) What is the folding mechanism? (c) Can we predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence? Once regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen great progress in recent years. Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

  abstract  = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {The state of intracellular water has been a matter of controversy for a long time for two reasons. First, experiments have often given conflicting results. Second, hitherto, there have been no plausible grounds for assuming that intracellular water should be significantly different from bulk water. A collective behavior of water molecules is suggested here as a thermodynamically inevitable mechanism for generation of appreciable zones of abnormal water. At a highly charged surface, water molecules move together, generating a zone of water perhaps 6 nm thick, which is weakly hydrogen bonded, fluid, and reactive and selectively accumulates small cations, multivalent anions, and hydrophobic solutes. At a hydrophobic surface, molecules move apart and local water becomes strongly bonded, inert, and viscous and accumulates large cations, univalent anions, and compatible solutes. Proteins and many other biopolymers have patchy surfaces which therefore induce, by the two mechanisms described, patchy interfacial water structures, which extended appreciable distances from the surface. The reason for many conflicting experimental results now becomes apparent. Average values of properties of water measured in gels, cells, or solutions of proteins are often not very different from the same properties of normal water, giving no indication that they are averages of extreme values. To detect the operation of this phenomenon, it is necessary to probe selectively a single abnormal population. Examples of such experiments are given. It is shown that this collective behavior of water molecules amounts to a considerable biological force, which can be equivalent to a pressure of 1,000 atm (1.013 x 10(5) kPa). It is suggested that cells selectively accumulate K+ ions and compatible solutes to avoid extremes of water structure in their aqueous compartments, but that cation pumps and other enzymes exploit the different solvent properties and reactivities of water to perform work of transport or synthesis.},

  abstract = {Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrates into cancerous growths, supplying nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. The process of angiogenesis plays an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions. Solid tumors depend on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis in a hostile environment. In the prevascular phase, the tumor is rarely larger than 2 to 3 mm3 and may contain a million or more cells. Up to this size, tumor cells can obtain the necessary oxygen and nutrient supplies required for growth and survival by simple passive diffusion. The properties of tumors to release and induce several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors which play crucial roles in regulating endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, apoptosis or survival, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through different intracellular signaling are thought to be the essential mechanisms during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis actually starts with tumor cells releasing molecules that send signals to surrounding normal host tissue. This signaling activates certain genes in the host tissue that, in turn, make proteins to encourage growth of new blood vessels. In this review, we focus the mechanisms of tumor-induced angiogenesis, with an emphasis on the regulatory role of several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents during the angiogenic process in tumors. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis have led to the development of several most effective anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic therapeutic agents and also have provided several techniques for the regulation of cancer's angiogenic switch. The suggestion is made that standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors used in combination may produce complementary therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer.},

  abstract   = {Tumor vascularization occurs through several distinct biological processes, which not only vary between tumor type and anatomic location, but also occur simultaneously within the same cancer tissue. These processes are orchestrated by a range of secreted factors and signaling pathways and can involve participation of non-endothelial cells, such as progenitors or cancer stem cells. Anti-angiogenic therapies using either antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved to treat several types of cancer. However, the benefit of treatment has so far been modest, some patients not responding at all and others acquiring resistance. It is becoming increasingly clear that blocking tumors from accessing the circulation is not an easy task to accomplish. Tumor vessel functionality and gene expression often differ vastly when comparing different cancer subtypes, and vessel phenotype can be markedly heterogeneous within a single tumor. Here, we summarize the current understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in tumor angiogenesis and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with vascular targeting.},

As one of the hallmarks of cancer, angiogenesis has been studied extensively in animal and human models to enable better understanding of cancer biology and the development of new anti-cancer treatments. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the process of tumour genesis, because solid tumour need a blood supply if they are to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that some solid tumour exploit existing normal blood supply and do not require a new vessel formation to grow and to undergo metastasis.

We showed that fluid shear stress enhanced EC migration in flow direction and called this “mechanotaxis.” To visualize the molecular dynamics of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at focal adhesions (FAs), FAK tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFP) was expressed in ECs. Within 10 min of shear stress application, lamellipodial protrusion was induced at cell periphery in the flow direction, with the recruitment of FAK at FAs. ECs under flow migrated with polarized formation of new FAs in flow direction, and these newly formed FAs subsequently disassembled after the rear of the cell moved over them. The cells migrating under flow had a decreased number of FAs. In contrast to shear stress, serum did not significantly affect the speed of cell migration. Serum induced lamellipodia and FAK recruitment at FAs without directional preference. FAK(Y397) phosphorylation colocalized with GFP-FAK at FAs in both shear stress and serum experiments. The total level of FAK(Y397) phosphorylation after shear stress was lower than that after serum treatment, suggesting that the polarized change at cell periphery rather than the total level of FAK(Y397) phosphorylation is important for directional migration. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of FAK at FAs during the directional migration of EC in response to mechanical force, and suggest that mechanotaxis is an important mechanism controlling EC migration.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.},

The effects of nutrients and inhibitors on the existence and stability of time-independent solutions are studied. With a single nutrient and no inhibitors present, the trivial solution, which corresponds to a state in which no tumor is present, persists for all parameter values, whereas the nontrivial solution, which corresponds to a tumor of finite size, exists for only a prescribed range of parameters, which corresponds to a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Stability analysis, based on a two-timing method, suggests that, where it exists, the nontrivial solution is stable and the trivial solution unstable. Otherwise, the trivial solution is stable. Modification to these characteristic states brought about by the presence of different types of inhibitors are also investigated and shown to have significant effect. Implications of the model for the treatment of cancer are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The growth of new capillary blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is a prominent component of numerous physiological and pathological conditions. An understanding of the co-ordination of underlying cellular behaviors would be helpful for therapeutic manipulation of the process. A probabilistic mathematical model of angiogenesis is developed based upon specific microvessel endothelial cell (MEC) functions involved in vessel growth. The model focuses on the roles of MEC random motility and chemotaxis, to test the hypothesis that these MEC behaviors are of critical importance in determining capillary growth rate and network structure. Model predictions are computer simulations of microvessel networks, from which questions of interest are examined both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results indicate that a moderate MEC chemotactic response toward an angiogenic stimulus, similar to that measured in vitroin response to acidic fibroblast growth factor, is necessary to provide directed vascular network growth. Persistent random motility alone, with initial budding biased toward the stimulus, does not adequately provide directed network growth. A significant degree of randomness in cell migration direction, however, is required for vessel anastomosis and capillary loop formation, as simulations with an overly strong chemotactic response produce network structures largely absent of these features. The predicted vessel extension rate and network structure in the simulations are quantitatively consistent with experimental observations of angiogenesis in vivo. This suggests that the rate of vessel outgrowth is primarily determined by MEC migration rate, and consequently that quantitative in vitromigration assays might be useful tools for the prescreening of possible angiogenesis activators and inhibitors. Finally, reduction of MEC speed results in substantial inhibition of simulated angiogenesis. Together, these results predict that both random motility and chemotaxis are MEC functions critically involved in determining the rate and morphology of new microvessel network growth.},

  abstract = {In silico cancer models have demonstrated great potential as a tool to improve drug design, optimise the delivery of drugs to target sites in the host tissue and, hence, improve therapeutic efficacy and patient outcome. However, there are significant barriers to the successful translation of in silico technology from bench to bedside. More precisely, the specification of unknown model parameters, the necessity for models to adequately reflect in vivo conditions, and the limited amount of pertinent validation data to evaluate models’ accuracy and assess their reliability, pose major obstacles in the path towards their clinical translation. This review aims to capture the state-of-the-art in in silico cancer modelling of vascularised solid tumour growth, and identify the important advances and barriers to success of these models in clinical oncology. Particular emphasis has been put on continuum-based models of cancer since they — amongst the class of mechanistic spatio-temporal modelling approaches — are well-established in simulating transport phenomena and the biomechanics of tissues, and have demonstrated potential for clinical translation. Three important avenues in in silico modelling are considered in this contribution: first, since systemic therapy is a major cancer treatment approach, we start with an overview of the tumour perfusion and angiogenesis in silico models. Next, we present the state-of-the-art in silico work encompassing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to cancer nanomedicines through the bloodstream, and then review continuum-based modelling approaches that demonstrate great promise for successful clinical translation. We conclude with a discussion of what we view to be the key challenges and opportunities for in silico modelling in personalised and precision medicine.},

  abstract  = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer’s ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

Similar mechanisms are also involved in the formation of the lymphatic system through a process generally called lymphangiogenesis. A number of mathematical approaches have been used to analyze these phenomena. In this paper, we review the different types of models, with special emphasis on their ability to reproduce different biological systems and to predict measurable quantities which describe the overall processes.

  abstract   = {Cancerous tumours have the ability to recruit new blood vessels through a process called angiogenesis. By stimulating vascular growth, tumours get connected to the circulatory system, receive nutrients and open a way to colonize distant organs. Tumour-induced vascular networks become unstable in the absence of tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs). They may undergo alternating stages of growth, regression and regrowth. Following a phase-field methodology, we propose a model of tumour angiogenesis that reproduces the aforementioned features and highlights the importance of vascular regression and regrowth. In contrast with previous theories which focus on vessel remodelling due to the absence of flow, we model an alternative regression mechanism based on the dependency of tumour-induced vascular networks on TAFs. The model captures capillaries at full scale, the plastic dynamics of tumour-induced vessel networks at long time scales, and shows the key role played by filopodia during angiogenesis. The predictions of our model are in agreement with in vivo experiments and may prove useful for the design of antiangiogenic therapies.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a hybrid two-dimensional multiscale model of angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) migrate from a pre-existing vascular bed in response to local environmental cues and cell-cell interactions, to create a new vascular network. Recent experimental studies have highlighted a central role of cell rearrangements in the formation of angiogenic networks. Our model accounts for this phenomenon via the heterogeneous response of ECs to their microenvironment. These cell rearrangements, in turn, dynamically remodel the local environment. The model reproduces characteristic features of angiogenic sprouting that include branching, chemotactic sensitivity, the brush border effect, and cell mixing. These properties, rather than being hardwired into the model, emerge naturally from the gene expression patterns of individual cells. After calibrating and validating our model against experimental data, we use it to predict how the structure of the vascular network changes as the baseline gene expression levels of the VEGF-Delta-Notch pathway, and the composition of the extracellular environment, vary. In order to investigate the impact of cell rearrangements on the vascular network structure, we introduce the mixing measure, a scalar metric that quantifies cell mixing as the vascular network grows. We calculate the mixing measure for the simulated vascular networks generated by ECs of different lineages (wild type cells and mutant cells with impaired expression of a specific receptor). Our results show that the time evolution of the mixing measure is directly correlated to the generic features of the vascular branching pattern, thus, supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangements play an essential role in sprouting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that lower cell rearrangement leads to an imbalance between branching and sprout elongation. Since the computation of this statistic requires only individual cell trajectories, it can be computed for networks generated in biological experiments, making it a potential biomarker for pathological angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {We develop an off-lattice, agent-based model to describe vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels from endothelial progenitor cells during development. The endothelial cells that comprise our vessel network are viewed as linearly elastic spheres that move in response to the forces they experience. We distinguish two types of endothelial cells: vessel elements are contained within the network and tip cells are located at the ends of vessels. Tip cells move in response to mechanical forces caused by interactions with neighbouring vessel elements and the local tissue environment, chemotactic forces and a persistence force which accounts for their tendency to continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements are subject to similar mechanical forces but are insensitive to chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing interactions with the local tissue is introduced to stabilise buckling instabilities caused by cell proliferation. Only vessel elements proliferate, at rates which depend on their degree of stretch: elongated elements have increased rates of proliferation, and compressed elements have reduced rates. Following division, the fate of the new cell depends on the local mechanical environment: the probability of forming a new sprout is increased if the parent vessel is highly compressed and the probability of being incorporated into the parent vessel increased if the parent is stretched. Simulation results reveal that our hybrid model can reproduce the key qualitative features of vasculogenesis. Extensive parameter sensitivity analyses show that significant changes in network size and morphology are induced by varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of the proliferation rate and the sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying the chemotactic sensitivity directly influences the directionality of the networks. The degree of branching, and thereby the density of the networks, is influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs that simultaneously depict several network properties are introduced to show how these and other network quantities change over time and also as model parameters vary. We also show how equivalent glyphs constructed from in vivo data could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and, in the longer term, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid model can generate vascular networks that are qualitatively similar to those generated from in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

We introduce a software library for composing multiscale, multiphysics models for applications including tumor growth, angiogenesis, osteogenesis, coronary perfusion, and oxygen delivery.

Recent advances in imaging have produced detailed three-dimensional (3D) datasets of vascularized tissues at the scale of individual cells. To fully exploit such data there is an increasing need for software that allows user-friendly composition of efficient, 3D models of vascularized tissues, and comparison of predictions with in vivo or in vitro experiments and alternative computational formulations. Microvessel Chaste can be used to build simulations of vessel growth and adaptation in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli; intra- and extravascular transport of nutrients, growth factors and drugs; and cell proliferation in complex 3D geometries. In addition, it can be used to develop custom software for integrating modeling with experimental data processing workflows, facilitated by a comprehensive Python interface to solvers implemented in C++. This article links to two reproducible example problems, showing how the library can be used to build simulations of tumor growth and angiogenesis with realistic vessel networks.},

To better understand the governing biophysical processes and their relative importance, it is instructive to develop physiologically representative mathematical models with which to compare to experimental data. Previous studies have successfully applied this approach to test the effect of various biochemical factors on tumour growth and angiogenesis. However, these models do not account for the experimentally observed dependency of angiogenic network evolution on growth-induced solid stresses. This work introduces two novel features: the effects of hapto- and mechanotaxis on vessel sprouting, and mechano-sensitive dynamic vascular remodelling. The proposed three-dimensional, multiscale, in-silico model of dynamically coupled angiogenic tumour growth is specified to in-vivo and in-vitro data, chosen, where possible, to provide a physiologically consistent description. The model is then validated against in-vivo data from murine mammary carcinomas, with particular focus placed on identifying the influence of mechanical factors. Crucially, we find that it is necessary to include hapto- and mechanotaxis to recapitulate observed time-varying spatial distributions of angiogenic vasculature.},

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators and aberrantly expressed in various types of human cancer. Our previous studies indicated that lncRNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) implicated in the regulation of blood-tumor barrier permeability; however, its role in glioblastoma angiogenesis still unclear. Here we demonstrated that TUG1 was up-expressed in human glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines. Knockdown of TUG1 remarkably suppressed tumor-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation as well as reducing spheroid-based angiogenesis ability in vitro, which are the critical steps for tumor angiogenesis. Besides, knockdown of TUG1 significantly increased the expression of mircroRNA-299 (miR-299), which was down-expressed in glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that TUG1 influenced tumor angiogenesis via directly binding to the miR-299 and there was a reciprocal repression between TUG1 and miR-299 in the same RNA-induced silencing complex. Moreover, knockdown of TUG1 reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which was defined as a functional downstream target of miR-299. In addition, knockdown of TUG1, shown in the in vivo studies, has effects on suppressing tumor growth, reducing tumor microvessel density and decreasing the VEGFA expression by upregulating miR-299 in xenograft glioblastoma model. Overall, the results demonstrated that TUG1 enhances tumor-induced angiogenesis and VEGF expression through inhibiting miR-299. Also, the inhibition of TUG1 could provide a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment.},

  abstract = {The complicated capillary network induced by angiogenesis is one of the main reasons of unsuccessful cancer therapy. A multi-scale mathematical method which simulates drug transport to a solid tumor is used in this study to investigate how capillary network structure affects drug delivery. The mathematical method involves processes such as blood flow through vessels, solute and fluid diffusion, convective transport in extracellular matrix, and extravasation from blood vessels. The effect of heterogeneous dynamic network on interstitial fluid flow and drug delivery is investigated by this multi-scale method. The sprouting angiogenesis model is used for generating capillary network and then fluid flow governing equations are implemented to calculate blood flow through the tumor-induced capillary network and fluid flow in normal and tumor tissues. Finally, convection–diffusion equation is used to simulate drug delivery. Three approaches are used to simulate drug transport based on the developed mathematical method: without a vascular network, using a static vascular network, and a dynamic vascular network. The avascular approach predicts more uniform and higher drug concentration than vascular approaches since the simplified assumptions are implemented in this method. The dynamic network which uses more realistic assumptions predicts more irregular blood vessels, high interstitial pressure, and more heterogeneity in drug distribution than other two approaches.},

In order to perform effective translational research for cancer therapy, we need to employ pre-clinical models which reflect the clinical situation. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively compare the vascular architecture of human colorectal cancer and experimental tumour models to determine the suitability of animal models for vascular studies and antivascular therapy.
Methods
In this study we investigated the three-dimensional properties of colonic tumour vasculature in both human clinical tissues (normal mucosa control [n=20], carcinoma [n=20] and adenoma [n=6]) and murine colorectal xenografts (LS147T [n=6] and SW1222 [n=6]). Scanning Electron Microscope Stereoimaging (SEM) and X-ray Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) methods were employed for 3D analyses of the vascular corrosion casts from these tissues.
Results
Morphological measurements showed that there were significant differences in the underlying morphology in the different tissues. Of the studied xenografts, LS147T is more consistently similar to the vascular architecture of the human carcinoma than SW1222. The only reversal of this is for the inter-vessel distance.
Conclusion
While SEM stereoimaging provided better surface detailed resolution of the corrosion casts, it was complimented by the fully 3D micro-CT method. Comparison made between the xenografts and clinical tumours showed that the LS147T xenografts shared many similarities with the clinical tumour vasculature. This study provides insight into how to select the most suitable pre-clinical models for translational studies of clinical cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Tumor vessels influence the growth and response of tumors to therapy. Imaging vascular changes in vivo using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) has shown potential to guide clinical decision making for treatment. However, quantitative MR imaging biomarkers of vascular function have not been widely adopted, partly because their relationship to structural changes in vessels remains unclear. We aimed to elucidate the relationships between vessel function and morphology in vivo.Experimental Design: Untreated preclinical tumors with different levels of vascularization were imaged sequentially using DCE-MRI and CT. Relationships between functional parameters from MR (iAUC, Ktrans, and BATfrac) and structural parameters from CT (vessel volume, radius, and tortuosity) were assessed using linear models. Tumors treated with anti-VEGFR2 antibody were then imaged to determine whether antiangiogenic therapy altered these relationships. Finally, functional–structural relationships were measured in 10 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Results: Functional parameters iAUC and Ktrans primarily reflected vessel volume in untreated preclinical tumors. The relationships varied spatially and with tumor vascularity, and were altered by antiangiogenic treatment. In human liver metastases, all three structural parameters were linearly correlated with iAUC and Ktrans. For iAUC, structural parameters also modified each other's effect.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MR imaging biomarkers of vascular function are linked to structural changes in tumor vessels and that antiangiogenic therapy can affect this link. Our work also demonstrates the feasibility of three-dimensional functional–structural validation of MR biomarkers in vivo to improve their biological interpretation and clinical utility.

  abstract  = {Despite the significance of tumour neoangiogenesis and the extensive knowledge on the molecular basis of blood vessel formation currently no quantitative data exist on the 3D microvascular architecture in human primary tumours and their precursor lesions. This prompted us to examine the 3D vascular network of normal colon mucosa, adenomas and invasive carcinomas by means of quantitative microvascular corrosion casting. Fresh hemicolectomy specimens from 20 patients undergoing cancer or polyposis coli surgery were used for corrosion casting, factor VIII and VEGF immunostaining. In addition, immunostaining was done on colorectal tissue from 33 patients with metastatic and non-metastatic carcinomas, polyposis coli and adenomas. This first quantitative analysis of intervessel and interbranching distances, branching angles and vessel diameters in human cancer specimens revealed distinct patterns of the microvascular unit in the tumour centre and periphery. Irrespective of the tumour localization and grading all individual tumours displayed qualitatively and quantitatively the same vascular architecture. This gives further evidence for the existence of a tumour type-specific vascular architecture as recently demonstrated for experimental tumours. Metastatic tumours displayed different vascular architectures only within hot spots, in terms of smaller intervascular distances than in non-metastatic tumours. Pre-cancerous lesions have in part virtually the same vascular architecture like invasive carcinomas. Comparison of VEGF immunostaining also suggests that angiogenesis sets in long before the progress towards invasive phenotypes and that the so-called angiogenic switch is more likely a sequence of events. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign},

Several quantitative angiogenesis assays exist, each with its own unique characteristics and disadvantages. In this review we discuss some of the commonly used assays, their methodological pitfalls and current use. The corneal micropocket and the CAM assay are well established. However, the matrix-implant assays have the potential advantage of replicating the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, thus making them suitable for the study of tumour angiogenesis. The ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay does not exist and the use of two complimentary quantitative assays, such as a matrix implant assay and a microcirculatory preparation like the CAM or corneal micropocket assay, provides the best compromise. Newer models like the hollow-fibre assay are being developed and older ones refined. Assay systems should reflect distinct disease processes. Thus it is appropriate to develop assays that study exclusively pro- or anti-angiogenic compounds or anti-vascular agents. Criticisms of currently available screening systems are that the predictive value of current screening systems remains to be established as anti-angiogenic agents are still in clinical development. Anti-angiogenic agents are likely to be most effective as chronic therapy for remission maintenance in the metastatic setting or as adjuvant therapy in patients at high risk of relapse, an important clinical aspect not addressed in animal models of tumour angiogenesis. Histological analysis still provides the most detailed information on in vivo angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is a dynamic process and assays that permit continuous monitoring of the angiogenic response and provide information on the physiological characteristics of new vessels will be distinctly advantageous over older systems. The development of non-invasive techniques for quantitation of angiogenesis will greatly facilitate this process.},

By routine histology, numerous microscopic vascular abnormalities are also present. The structural expansion of capillaries and distinctive activated phenotype of lesional endothelial cells are believed not only to be clinical and pathologic hallmarks of the disease, but to play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic plaques. Despite over 20 years of research by leading angiogenesis experts and numerous studies, many details regarding the cellular and molecular basis for angiogenesis in psoriasis remain unknown. In this review, 10 different sections are presented to update recent progress in this active field of investigative skin biology. Highlights of this review include the phenotypic characterization of endothelial cells in acute and chronic psoriatic plaques, and a review of a novel animal model of psoriasis using human skin engrafted onto severe combined immunodeficient mice followed by injection of activated immunocytes. This new experimental model represents a reproducible and pharmacologically validated method to trigger neovascularization and bona fide psoriatic plaque formation. In addition, the potential contribution of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal macrophages to the angiogenic tissue reaction is presented, and a series of questions are then posed that can be answered using the severe combined immunodeficient mouse model of psoriasis. Finally, a model is proposed integrating all available data into a coherent multistep reaction schema that includes active participation by multiple cell types including natural killer T cells, keratinocytes, macrophages, and microvascular endothelial cells.},

Recent findingsExperimental data extends beyond the tip cell vs. stalk cell paradigm, and involves numerous molecular inputs such as vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch. This data is being used to generate and validate computational models, which can then be used to predict the results of hypothetical experiments that are difficult to perform in the laboratory, and to generate new hypotheses that account for system-wide interactions. As a result of this integration, descriptions of critical gradients of growth factor–receptor complexes have been generated, and new modulators of cell behavior have been described.

  abstract   = {Over the past 40 years, there has been a strong focus on the development of mathematical models of angiogenesis, while developmental remodelling has received little such attention from the mathematical community. Sprouting angiogenesis can be seen as a very crude way of laying out a primitive vessel network (the raw material), while remodelling (understood as pruning of redundant vessels, diameter control, and the establishment of vessel identity and hierarchy) is the key to turning that primitive network into a functional network. This multiscale problem is of prime importance in the development of a functional vasculature. In addition, defective remodelling (either during developmental remodelling or due to a reactivation of the remodelling programme caused by an injury) is associated with a significant number of diseases. In this review, we discuss existing mathematical models of developmental remodelling and explore the important contributions that these models have made to the field of vascular development. These mathematical models are effectively used to investigate and predict vascular development and are able to reproduce experimentally observable results. Moreover, these models provide a useful means of hypothesis generation and can explain the underlying mechanisms driving the observed structural and functional network development. However, developmental vascular remodelling is still a relatively new area in mathematical biology, and many biological questions remain unanswered. In this review, we present the existing modelling paradigms and define the key challenges for the field.},

It is an essential process in the formation and development of blood vessels, so it is supportive in healing of wound while its inhibition may help to restrict the size of tumor. To quantify the effect of an agent on angiogenesis, a standardized preclinical screening assay is necessary. The objective of this review is to document all the methods of angiogenesis assessment and specific techniques to quantify the results, majorly focusing on the modes of calculation and concerns that researchers need to make before reaching to any conclusion. Scientific research on angiogenesis relies on different models for assessment, including in vitro, in vivo and in ovo models. Many of these assays are practiced to test the effect of both pro and anti angiogenic agents. The ﬁndings articulated in this study will help to provide better visions into the pathophysiology of diseases associated with angiogenesis and to establish new as well as appropriate angiogenic or anti angiogenic treatment strategies for the future. Nevertheless, angiogenesis is a vigorous process and the techniques to evaluate this process with thorough assessment of physiological characteristics of new blood vessels will be advantageous over the older systems of angiogenesis assessment methods.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is required for many pathologic processes, including invasive tumor growth as well as physiologic organ/tissue maintenance. Angiogenesis during development and adulthood is likely regulated by a balance between endogenous proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. It is speculated that tumor growth requires disruption of such balance; thus, the angiogenic switch must be turned "on" for cancer progression. If the angiogenic switch needs to be turned on to facilitate the tumor growth, the question remains as to what the physiologic status of this switch is in the adult human body; is it "off," with inhibitors outweighing the stimulators, or maintained at a fine "balance," keeping the proangiogenic properties of many factors at a delicate "activity" balance with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. The physiologic status of this balance is important to understand as it might determine an individual's predisposition to turn the switch on during pathologic events dependent on angiogenesis. Conceivably, if the physiologic angiogenesis balance in human population exists somewhere between off and even balance, an individual's capacity and rate to turn the switch on might reflect their normal physiologic angiogenic status. In this regard, although extensive knowledge has been gained in our understanding of endogenous growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis, the activities associated with endogenous inhibitors are poorly understood. In this review, we will present an overview of the knowledge gained in studies related to the identification and characterization of 27 different endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial cell migration, and organize themselves into a branched, connected network. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout-tips permits further extension of the capillaries and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumours. In this article we first of all present a review of a variety of mathematical models which have been used to describe the formation of capillary networks and then focus on a specific recent model which uses novel mathematical modelling techniques to generate both two- and three-dimensional vascular structures. The modelling focusses on key events of angiogenesis such as the migratory response of endothelial cells to exogenous cytokines (tumour angiogenic factors, TAF) secreted by a solid tumour; endothelial cell proliferation; endothelial cell interactions with extracellular matrix macromolecules such as fibronectin; capillary sprout branching and anastomosis. Numerical simulations of the model, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and the theoretical structures generated by the model are compared with the morphology of actual capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments. A final conclusions section discusses the use of the mathematical model as a possible angiogenesis assay.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, a number of mathematical and computational models have been developed to study different aspects of angiogenesis that span the spatial and temporal scales encompassed by this complex process. For example, models have been built to investigate how growth factors and receptors signal endothelial cell proliferation, how groups of endothelial cells assemble into individual vessels, and how tumors recruit the ingrowth of whole microvascular networks. A prudent question to pose is: “what have we learned from these models?” This review aims to answer this question as it pertains to angiogenesis in the context of normal physiological growth, tumorigenesis, wound healing, tissue engineering, and the design of therapeutic strategies. We also provide a framework for parsing angiogenesis models into categories, according to the type of modeling approach used, the spatial and temporal scales simulated, and the overarching question being posed to the model. Finally, this review introduces some of the simplification strategies and assumptions used in model building, discusses model validation, and makes recommendations for application of modeling approaches to unresolved questions in the field.},

  abstract   = {Angiogenesis, the growth of a network of blood vessels, is a crucial component of solid tumour growth, linking the relatively harmless avascular growth phase and the potentially fatal vascular growth phase. As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration, proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel (sprout) formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is blood flow associated with the nascent network, the subsequent growth of the network evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix and perfusion-related haemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this paper we present a mathematical model which simultaneously couples vessel growth with blood flow through the vessels--dynamic adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (DATIA). This new mathematical model presents a theoretical and computational investigation of the process and highlights a number of important new targets for therapeutic intervention. In contrast to earlier flow models, where the effects of perfusion (blood flow) were essentially evaluated a posteriori, i.e. after generating a hollow network, blood flow in the model described in this paper has a direct impact during capillary growth, with radial adaptations and network remodelling occurring as immediate consequences of primary anastomoses. Capillary network architectures resulting from the dynamically adaptive model are found to differ radically from those obtained using earlier models. The DATIA model is used to examine the effects of changing various physical and biological model parameters on the developing vascular architecture and the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumour. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic treatments under different parameter regimes lead to the identification of a number of new therapeutic targets for tumour management.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years, numerous research groups have attempted to provide mathematical descriptions of the skin wound healing process. The development of theoretical models of the interlinked processes that underlie the healing mechanism has yielded considerable insight into aspects of this critical phenomenon that remain difficult to investigate empirically. In particular, the mathematical modeling of angiogenesis, i.e., capillary sprout growth, has offered new paradigms for the understanding of this highly complex and crucial step in the healing pathway. With the recent advances in imaging and cell tracking, the time is now ripe for an appraisal of the utility and importance of mathematical modeling in wound healing angiogenesis research. The purpose of this review is to pedagogically elucidate the conceptual principles that have underpinned the development of mathematical descriptions of wound healing angiogenesis, specifically those that have utilized a continuum reaction-transport framework, and highlight the contribution that such models have made toward the advancement of research in this field. We aim to draw attention to the common assumptions made when developing models of this nature, thereby bringing into focus the advantages and limitations of this approach. A deeper integration of mathematical modeling techniques into the practice of wound healing angiogenesis research promises new perspectives for advancing our knowledge in this area. To this end we detail several open problems related to the understanding of wound healing angiogenesis, and outline how these issues could be addressed through closer cross-disciplinary collaboration.},

  abstract = {Computational models of cancer complement the biological study of tumor growth. However, existing modeling approaches can be both inefficient and inaccurate due to the difficulties of representing the complex interactions between cells and tissues. We present a three-dimensional multiscale agent-based model of tumor growth with angiogenesis. The model is designed to easily adapt to various cancer types, although we focus on breast cancer. It includes cellular (genetic control), tissue (cells, blood vessels, angiogenesis), and molecular (VEGF, diffusion) levels of representation. Unlike in most cancer models, both normally functioning tissue cells and tumor cells are included in the model. Tumors grow following the expected spheroid cluster pattern, with growth limited by available oxygen. Angiogenesis, the process by which tumors may encourage new vessel growth for nutrient diffusion, is modeled with a new discrete approach that we propose will decrease computational cost. Our results show that despite proposing these new abstractions, we see similar results to previously accepted angiogenesis models. This may indicate that a more discrete approach should be considered by modelers in the future.},

Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models.

However, efforts to model these systems often rely on either purely stochastic or purely rule-based methods. To better understand the balance between stochasticity and determinism in biological processes a computational approach that incorporates both influences may afford additional insight into underlying biological mechanisms that give rise to emergent system properties. We apply a combined approach to the simulation and study of angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from existing networks. This complex multicellular process begins with selection of an initiating endothelial cell, or tip cell, which sprouts from the parent vessels in response to stimulation by exogenous cues. We have constructed an agent-based model of sprouting angiogenesis to evaluate endothelial cell sprout initiation frequency and location, and we have experimentally validated it using high-resolution time-lapse confocal microscopy. ABM simulations were then compared to a Monte Carlo model, revealing that purely stochastic simulations could not generate sprout locations as accurately as the rule-informed agent-based model. These findings support the use of rule-based approaches for modeling the complex mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis over purely stochastic methods.},

Numerical simulations show: 1), different tumor-secreted pro-angiogenic factor gradient profiles dramatically affect capillary sprout morphology; 2), average sprout extension speeds depend on the proximity of the proliferating region to the sprout tip, and the coordination of cellular functions; and 3), inhomogeneities in the extravascular tissue lead to sprout branching and anastomosis, phenomena that emerge without any prescribed rules.

The model comprises 108 arterial segments, with 64 main arteries and 44 perforator arteries, with lumen radii ranging from 0.24 cm - axillary artery- to 0.018 cm - perforator arteries. The modeling of blood flow in deformable vessels is governed by a well-known set of hyperbolic partial differential equations that accounts for mass and momentum conservation and a constitutive equation for the arterial wall. The variational formulation used to solve the problem and the related numerical approach are described. The model rendered consistent pressure and flow rate outputs when compared with patient records already published in the literature. In addition, an application to dimensionally-heterogeneous modeling is presented in which the developed arterial network is employed as an underlying model for a three-dimensional geometry of a branching point to be embedded in order to perform local analyses.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is the process through which new blood vessels are formed from preexisting ones and plays a critical role in several conditions including embryonic development, tissue repair and disease. Moreover, enhanced therapeutic angiogenesis is a major goal in the field of regenerative medicine and efficient vascularization of artificial tissues and organs is one of the main hindrances in the implementation of tissue engineering approaches, while, on the other hand, inhibition of angiogenesis is a key therapeutic target to inhibit for instance tumor growth. During the last decades, the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process has been matter of intense research. In this regard, several in vitro and in vivo models have been established to visualize and study migration of endothelial progenitor cells, formation of endothelial tubules and the generation of new vascular networks, while assessing the conditions and treatments that either promote or inhibit such processes. In this review, we address and compare the most commonly used experimental models to study angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we focus on the implementation of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to study angiogenesis and discuss the advantages and not yet explored possibilities of its use as model organism.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is the generation of mature vascular networks from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is crucial during the organism' development, for wound healing and for the female reproductive cycle. Several murine experimental systems are well suited for studying developmental and pathological angiogenesis. They include the embryonic hindbrain, the post-natal retina and allantois explants. In these systems vascular networks are visualised by appropriate staining procedures followed by microscopical analysis. Nevertheless, quantitative assessment of angiogenesis is hampered by the lack of readily available, standardized metrics and software analysis tools. Non-automated protocols are being used widely and they are, in general, time - and labour intensive, prone to human error and do not permit computation of complex spatial metrics. We have developed a light-weight, user friendly software, AngioTool, which allows for quick, hands-off and reproducible quantification of vascular networks in microscopic images. AngioTool computes several morphological and spatial parameters including the area covered by a vascular network, the number of vessels, vessel length, vascular density and lacunarity. In addition, AngioTool calculates the so-called “branching index” (branch points / unit area), providing a measurement of the sprouting activity of a specimen of interest. We have validated AngioTool using images of embryonic murine hindbrains, post-natal retinas and allantois explants. AngioTool is open source and can be downloaded free of charge.},

  abstract = {The cerebrovasculature is essential to brain health and is tasked with ensuring adequate delivery of oxygen and metabolic precursors to ensure normal neurologic function. This is coordinated through a dynamic, multi-directional cellular interplay between vascular, neuronal, and glial cells. Molecular exchanges across the blood–brain barrier or the close matching of regional blood flow with brain activation are not uniformly assigned to arteries, capillaries, and veins. Evidence has supported functional segmentation of the brain vasculature. This is achieved in part through morphologic or transcriptional heterogeneity of brain vascular cells—including endothelium, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle. Advances with single cell genomic technologies have shown increasing cell complexity of the brain vasculature identifying previously unknown cell types and further subclassifying transcriptional diversity in cardinal vascular cell types. Cell-type specific molecular transitions or zonations have been identified. In this review, we summarize emerging evidence for the expanding vascular cell diversity in the brain and how this may provide a cellular basis for functional segmentation along the arterial-venous axis.},

  abstract   = {Tumour angiogenesis leads to the formation of blood vessels that are structurally and spatially heterogeneous. Poor blood perfusion, in conjunction with increased hypoxia and oxygen heterogeneity, impairs a tumour’s response to radiotherapy. The optimal strategy for enhancing tumour perfusion remains unclear, preventing its regular deployment in combination therapies. In this work, we first identify vascular architectural features that correlate with enhanced perfusion following radiotherapy, using in vivo imaging data from vascular tumours. Then, we present a novel computational model to determine the relationship between these architectural features and blood perfusion in silico. If perfusion is defined to be the proportion of vessels that support blood flow, we find that vascular networks with small mean diameters and large numbers of angiogenic sprouts show the largest increases in perfusion post-irradiation for both biological and synthetic tumours. We also identify cases where perfusion increases due to the pruning of hypoperfused vessels, rather than blood being rerouted. These results indicate the importance of considering network composition when determining the optimal irradiation strategy. In the future, we aim to use our findings to identify tumours that are good candidates for perfusion enhancement and to improve the efficacy of combination therapies.},
