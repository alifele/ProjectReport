  abstract = {The “protein folding problem” consists of three closely related puzzles: (a) What is the folding code? (b) What is the folding mechanism? (c) Can we predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence? Once regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen great progress in recent years. Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

  abstract  = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {The state of intracellular water has been a matter of controversy for a long time for two reasons. First, experiments have often given conflicting results. Second, hitherto, there have been no plausible grounds for assuming that intracellular water should be significantly different from bulk water. A collective behavior of water molecules is suggested here as a thermodynamically inevitable mechanism for generation of appreciable zones of abnormal water. At a highly charged surface, water molecules move together, generating a zone of water perhaps 6 nm thick, which is weakly hydrogen bonded, fluid, and reactive and selectively accumulates small cations, multivalent anions, and hydrophobic solutes. At a hydrophobic surface, molecules move apart and local water becomes strongly bonded, inert, and viscous and accumulates large cations, univalent anions, and compatible solutes. Proteins and many other biopolymers have patchy surfaces which therefore induce, by the two mechanisms described, patchy interfacial water structures, which extended appreciable distances from the surface. The reason for many conflicting experimental results now becomes apparent. Average values of properties of water measured in gels, cells, or solutions of proteins are often not very different from the same properties of normal water, giving no indication that they are averages of extreme values. To detect the operation of this phenomenon, it is necessary to probe selectively a single abnormal population. Examples of such experiments are given. It is shown that this collective behavior of water molecules amounts to a considerable biological force, which can be equivalent to a pressure of 1,000 atm (1.013 x 10(5) kPa). It is suggested that cells selectively accumulate K+ ions and compatible solutes to avoid extremes of water structure in their aqueous compartments, but that cation pumps and other enzymes exploit the different solvent properties and reactivities of water to perform work of transport or synthesis.},

  abstract = {Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrates into cancerous growths, supplying nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. The process of angiogenesis plays an important role in many physiological and pathological conditions. Solid tumors depend on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis in a hostile environment. In the prevascular phase, the tumor is rarely larger than 2 to 3 mm3 and may contain a million or more cells. Up to this size, tumor cells can obtain the necessary oxygen and nutrient supplies required for growth and survival by simple passive diffusion. The properties of tumors to release and induce several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors which play crucial roles in regulating endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration, apoptosis or survival, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through different intracellular signaling are thought to be the essential mechanisms during tumor-induced angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis actually starts with tumor cells releasing molecules that send signals to surrounding normal host tissue. This signaling activates certain genes in the host tissue that, in turn, make proteins to encourage growth of new blood vessels. In this review, we focus the mechanisms of tumor-induced angiogenesis, with an emphasis on the regulatory role of several angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents during the angiogenic process in tumors. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis have led to the development of several most effective anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic therapeutic agents and also have provided several techniques for the regulation of cancer's angiogenic switch. The suggestion is made that standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and angiogenesis inhibitors used in combination may produce complementary therapeutic benefits in the treatment of cancer.},

  abstract   = {Tumor vascularization occurs through several distinct biological processes, which not only vary between tumor type and anatomic location, but also occur simultaneously within the same cancer tissue. These processes are orchestrated by a range of secreted factors and signaling pathways and can involve participation of non-endothelial cells, such as progenitors or cancer stem cells. Anti-angiogenic therapies using either antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved to treat several types of cancer. However, the benefit of treatment has so far been modest, some patients not responding at all and others acquiring resistance. It is becoming increasingly clear that blocking tumors from accessing the circulation is not an easy task to accomplish. Tumor vessel functionality and gene expression often differ vastly when comparing different cancer subtypes, and vessel phenotype can be markedly heterogeneous within a single tumor. Here, we summarize the current understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in tumor angiogenesis and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with vascular targeting.},

As one of the hallmarks of cancer, angiogenesis has been studied extensively in animal and human models to enable better understanding of cancer biology and the development of new anti-cancer treatments. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the process of tumour genesis, because solid tumour need a blood supply if they are to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. On the other hand, there is growing evidence that some solid tumour exploit existing normal blood supply and do not require a new vessel formation to grow and to undergo metastasis.

We showed that fluid shear stress enhanced EC migration in flow direction and called this “mechanotaxis.” To visualize the molecular dynamics of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at focal adhesions (FAs), FAK tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFP) was expressed in ECs. Within 10 min of shear stress application, lamellipodial protrusion was induced at cell periphery in the flow direction, with the recruitment of FAK at FAs. ECs under flow migrated with polarized formation of new FAs in flow direction, and these newly formed FAs subsequently disassembled after the rear of the cell moved over them. The cells migrating under flow had a decreased number of FAs. In contrast to shear stress, serum did not significantly affect the speed of cell migration. Serum induced lamellipodia and FAK recruitment at FAs without directional preference. FAK(Y397) phosphorylation colocalized with GFP-FAK at FAs in both shear stress and serum experiments. The total level of FAK(Y397) phosphorylation after shear stress was lower than that after serum treatment, suggesting that the polarized change at cell periphery rather than the total level of FAK(Y397) phosphorylation is important for directional migration. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of FAK at FAs during the directional migration of EC in response to mechanical force, and suggest that mechanotaxis is an important mechanism controlling EC migration.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.},

The effects of nutrients and inhibitors on the existence and stability of time-independent solutions are studied. With a single nutrient and no inhibitors present, the trivial solution, which corresponds to a state in which no tumor is present, persists for all parameter values, whereas the nontrivial solution, which corresponds to a tumor of finite size, exists for only a prescribed range of parameters, which corresponds to a balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Stability analysis, based on a two-timing method, suggests that, where it exists, the nontrivial solution is stable and the trivial solution unstable. Otherwise, the trivial solution is stable. Modification to these characteristic states brought about by the presence of different types of inhibitors are also investigated and shown to have significant effect. Implications of the model for the treatment of cancer are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The growth of new capillary blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is a prominent component of numerous physiological and pathological conditions. An understanding of the co-ordination of underlying cellular behaviors would be helpful for therapeutic manipulation of the process. A probabilistic mathematical model of angiogenesis is developed based upon specific microvessel endothelial cell (MEC) functions involved in vessel growth. The model focuses on the roles of MEC random motility and chemotaxis, to test the hypothesis that these MEC behaviors are of critical importance in determining capillary growth rate and network structure. Model predictions are computer simulations of microvessel networks, from which questions of interest are examined both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results indicate that a moderate MEC chemotactic response toward an angiogenic stimulus, similar to that measured in vitroin response to acidic fibroblast growth factor, is necessary to provide directed vascular network growth. Persistent random motility alone, with initial budding biased toward the stimulus, does not adequately provide directed network growth. A significant degree of randomness in cell migration direction, however, is required for vessel anastomosis and capillary loop formation, as simulations with an overly strong chemotactic response produce network structures largely absent of these features. The predicted vessel extension rate and network structure in the simulations are quantitatively consistent with experimental observations of angiogenesis in vivo. This suggests that the rate of vessel outgrowth is primarily determined by MEC migration rate, and consequently that quantitative in vitromigration assays might be useful tools for the prescreening of possible angiogenesis activators and inhibitors. Finally, reduction of MEC speed results in substantial inhibition of simulated angiogenesis. Together, these results predict that both random motility and chemotaxis are MEC functions critically involved in determining the rate and morphology of new microvessel network growth.},

  abstract = {In silico cancer models have demonstrated great potential as a tool to improve drug design, optimise the delivery of drugs to target sites in the host tissue and, hence, improve therapeutic efficacy and patient outcome. However, there are significant barriers to the successful translation of in silico technology from bench to bedside. More precisely, the specification of unknown model parameters, the necessity for models to adequately reflect in vivo conditions, and the limited amount of pertinent validation data to evaluate models’ accuracy and assess their reliability, pose major obstacles in the path towards their clinical translation. This review aims to capture the state-of-the-art in in silico cancer modelling of vascularised solid tumour growth, and identify the important advances and barriers to success of these models in clinical oncology. Particular emphasis has been put on continuum-based models of cancer since they — amongst the class of mechanistic spatio-temporal modelling approaches — are well-established in simulating transport phenomena and the biomechanics of tissues, and have demonstrated potential for clinical translation. Three important avenues in in silico modelling are considered in this contribution: first, since systemic therapy is a major cancer treatment approach, we start with an overview of the tumour perfusion and angiogenesis in silico models. Next, we present the state-of-the-art in silico work encompassing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to cancer nanomedicines through the bloodstream, and then review continuum-based modelling approaches that demonstrate great promise for successful clinical translation. We conclude with a discussion of what we view to be the key challenges and opportunities for in silico modelling in personalised and precision medicine.},

  abstract  = {Cancer biology involves complex, dynamic interactions between cancer cells and their tissue microenvironments. Single-cell effects are critical drivers of clinical progression. Chemical and mechanical communication between tumor and stromal cells can co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer’s ability to test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models) simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues, which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models. Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud computing resources make software easier to access and supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new therapeutic strategies, and even re-engineer tumor and stromal cells to bring cancer systems under control.},

Similar mechanisms are also involved in the formation of the lymphatic system through a process generally called lymphangiogenesis. A number of mathematical approaches have been used to analyze these phenomena. In this paper, we review the different types of models, with special emphasis on their ability to reproduce different biological systems and to predict measurable quantities which describe the overall processes.

  abstract   = {Cancerous tumours have the ability to recruit new blood vessels through a process called angiogenesis. By stimulating vascular growth, tumours get connected to the circulatory system, receive nutrients and open a way to colonize distant organs. Tumour-induced vascular networks become unstable in the absence of tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs). They may undergo alternating stages of growth, regression and regrowth. Following a phase-field methodology, we propose a model of tumour angiogenesis that reproduces the aforementioned features and highlights the importance of vascular regression and regrowth. In contrast with previous theories which focus on vessel remodelling due to the absence of flow, we model an alternative regression mechanism based on the dependency of tumour-induced vascular networks on TAFs. The model captures capillaries at full scale, the plastic dynamics of tumour-induced vessel networks at long time scales, and shows the key role played by filopodia during angiogenesis. The predictions of our model are in agreement with in vivo experiments and may prove useful for the design of antiangiogenic therapies.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a hybrid two-dimensional multiscale model of angiogenesis, the process by which endothelial cells (ECs) migrate from a pre-existing vascular bed in response to local environmental cues and cell-cell interactions, to create a new vascular network. Recent experimental studies have highlighted a central role of cell rearrangements in the formation of angiogenic networks. Our model accounts for this phenomenon via the heterogeneous response of ECs to their microenvironment. These cell rearrangements, in turn, dynamically remodel the local environment. The model reproduces characteristic features of angiogenic sprouting that include branching, chemotactic sensitivity, the brush border effect, and cell mixing. These properties, rather than being hardwired into the model, emerge naturally from the gene expression patterns of individual cells. After calibrating and validating our model against experimental data, we use it to predict how the structure of the vascular network changes as the baseline gene expression levels of the VEGF-Delta-Notch pathway, and the composition of the extracellular environment, vary. In order to investigate the impact of cell rearrangements on the vascular network structure, we introduce the mixing measure, a scalar metric that quantifies cell mixing as the vascular network grows. We calculate the mixing measure for the simulated vascular networks generated by ECs of different lineages (wild type cells and mutant cells with impaired expression of a specific receptor). Our results show that the time evolution of the mixing measure is directly correlated to the generic features of the vascular branching pattern, thus, supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangements play an essential role in sprouting angiogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that lower cell rearrangement leads to an imbalance between branching and sprout elongation. Since the computation of this statistic requires only individual cell trajectories, it can be computed for networks generated in biological experiments, making it a potential biomarker for pathological angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {We develop an off-lattice, agent-based model to describe vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels from endothelial progenitor cells during development. The endothelial cells that comprise our vessel network are viewed as linearly elastic spheres that move in response to the forces they experience. We distinguish two types of endothelial cells: vessel elements are contained within the network and tip cells are located at the ends of vessels. Tip cells move in response to mechanical forces caused by interactions with neighbouring vessel elements and the local tissue environment, chemotactic forces and a persistence force which accounts for their tendency to continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements are subject to similar mechanical forces but are insensitive to chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing interactions with the local tissue is introduced to stabilise buckling instabilities caused by cell proliferation. Only vessel elements proliferate, at rates which depend on their degree of stretch: elongated elements have increased rates of proliferation, and compressed elements have reduced rates. Following division, the fate of the new cell depends on the local mechanical environment: the probability of forming a new sprout is increased if the parent vessel is highly compressed and the probability of being incorporated into the parent vessel increased if the parent is stretched. Simulation results reveal that our hybrid model can reproduce the key qualitative features of vasculogenesis. Extensive parameter sensitivity analyses show that significant changes in network size and morphology are induced by varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of the proliferation rate and the sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying the chemotactic sensitivity directly influences the directionality of the networks. The degree of branching, and thereby the density of the networks, is influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs that simultaneously depict several network properties are introduced to show how these and other network quantities change over time and also as model parameters vary. We also show how equivalent glyphs constructed from in vivo data could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and, in the longer term, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid model can generate vascular networks that are qualitatively similar to those generated from in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

We introduce a software library for composing multiscale, multiphysics models for applications including tumor growth, angiogenesis, osteogenesis, coronary perfusion, and oxygen delivery.

Recent advances in imaging have produced detailed three-dimensional (3D) datasets of vascularized tissues at the scale of individual cells. To fully exploit such data there is an increasing need for software that allows user-friendly composition of efficient, 3D models of vascularized tissues, and comparison of predictions with in vivo or in vitro experiments and alternative computational formulations. Microvessel Chaste can be used to build simulations of vessel growth and adaptation in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli; intra- and extravascular transport of nutrients, growth factors and drugs; and cell proliferation in complex 3D geometries. In addition, it can be used to develop custom software for integrating modeling with experimental data processing workflows, facilitated by a comprehensive Python interface to solvers implemented in C++. This article links to two reproducible example problems, showing how the library can be used to build simulations of tumor growth and angiogenesis with realistic vessel networks.},

To better understand the governing biophysical processes and their relative importance, it is instructive to develop physiologically representative mathematical models with which to compare to experimental data. Previous studies have successfully applied this approach to test the effect of various biochemical factors on tumour growth and angiogenesis. However, these models do not account for the experimentally observed dependency of angiogenic network evolution on growth-induced solid stresses. This work introduces two novel features: the effects of hapto- and mechanotaxis on vessel sprouting, and mechano-sensitive dynamic vascular remodelling. The proposed three-dimensional, multiscale, in-silico model of dynamically coupled angiogenic tumour growth is specified to in-vivo and in-vitro data, chosen, where possible, to provide a physiologically consistent description. The model is then validated against in-vivo data from murine mammary carcinomas, with particular focus placed on identifying the influence of mechanical factors. Crucially, we find that it is necessary to include hapto- and mechanotaxis to recapitulate observed time-varying spatial distributions of angiogenic vasculature.},

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators and aberrantly expressed in various types of human cancer. Our previous studies indicated that lncRNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) implicated in the regulation of blood-tumor barrier permeability; however, its role in glioblastoma angiogenesis still unclear. Here we demonstrated that TUG1 was up-expressed in human glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines. Knockdown of TUG1 remarkably suppressed tumor-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation as well as reducing spheroid-based angiogenesis ability in vitro, which are the critical steps for tumor angiogenesis. Besides, knockdown of TUG1 significantly increased the expression of mircroRNA-299 (miR-299), which was down-expressed in glioblastoma tissues and glioblastoma cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that TUG1 influenced tumor angiogenesis via directly binding to the miR-299 and there was a reciprocal repression between TUG1 and miR-299 in the same RNA-induced silencing complex. Moreover, knockdown of TUG1 reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which was defined as a functional downstream target of miR-299. In addition, knockdown of TUG1, shown in the in vivo studies, has effects on suppressing tumor growth, reducing tumor microvessel density and decreasing the VEGFA expression by upregulating miR-299 in xenograft glioblastoma model. Overall, the results demonstrated that TUG1 enhances tumor-induced angiogenesis and VEGF expression through inhibiting miR-299. Also, the inhibition of TUG1 could provide a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment.},

  abstract = {The complicated capillary network induced by angiogenesis is one of the main reasons of unsuccessful cancer therapy. A multi-scale mathematical method which simulates drug transport to a solid tumor is used in this study to investigate how capillary network structure affects drug delivery. The mathematical method involves processes such as blood flow through vessels, solute and fluid diffusion, convective transport in extracellular matrix, and extravasation from blood vessels. The effect of heterogeneous dynamic network on interstitial fluid flow and drug delivery is investigated by this multi-scale method. The sprouting angiogenesis model is used for generating capillary network and then fluid flow governing equations are implemented to calculate blood flow through the tumor-induced capillary network and fluid flow in normal and tumor tissues. Finally, convection–diffusion equation is used to simulate drug delivery. Three approaches are used to simulate drug transport based on the developed mathematical method: without a vascular network, using a static vascular network, and a dynamic vascular network. The avascular approach predicts more uniform and higher drug concentration than vascular approaches since the simplified assumptions are implemented in this method. The dynamic network which uses more realistic assumptions predicts more irregular blood vessels, high interstitial pressure, and more heterogeneity in drug distribution than other two approaches.},

In order to perform effective translational research for cancer therapy, we need to employ pre-clinical models which reflect the clinical situation. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively compare the vascular architecture of human colorectal cancer and experimental tumour models to determine the suitability of animal models for vascular studies and antivascular therapy.
Methods
In this study we investigated the three-dimensional properties of colonic tumour vasculature in both human clinical tissues (normal mucosa control [n=20], carcinoma [n=20] and adenoma [n=6]) and murine colorectal xenografts (LS147T [n=6] and SW1222 [n=6]). Scanning Electron Microscope Stereoimaging (SEM) and X-ray Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) methods were employed for 3D analyses of the vascular corrosion casts from these tissues.
Results
Morphological measurements showed that there were significant differences in the underlying morphology in the different tissues. Of the studied xenografts, LS147T is more consistently similar to the vascular architecture of the human carcinoma than SW1222. The only reversal of this is for the inter-vessel distance.
Conclusion
While SEM stereoimaging provided better surface detailed resolution of the corrosion casts, it was complimented by the fully 3D micro-CT method. Comparison made between the xenografts and clinical tumours showed that the LS147T xenografts shared many similarities with the clinical tumour vasculature. This study provides insight into how to select the most suitable pre-clinical models for translational studies of clinical cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Tumor vessels influence the growth and response of tumors to therapy. Imaging vascular changes in vivo using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) has shown potential to guide clinical decision making for treatment. However, quantitative MR imaging biomarkers of vascular function have not been widely adopted, partly because their relationship to structural changes in vessels remains unclear. We aimed to elucidate the relationships between vessel function and morphology in vivo.Experimental Design: Untreated preclinical tumors with different levels of vascularization were imaged sequentially using DCE-MRI and CT. Relationships between functional parameters from MR (iAUC, Ktrans, and BATfrac) and structural parameters from CT (vessel volume, radius, and tortuosity) were assessed using linear models. Tumors treated with anti-VEGFR2 antibody were then imaged to determine whether antiangiogenic therapy altered these relationships. Finally, functional–structural relationships were measured in 10 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Results: Functional parameters iAUC and Ktrans primarily reflected vessel volume in untreated preclinical tumors. The relationships varied spatially and with tumor vascularity, and were altered by antiangiogenic treatment. In human liver metastases, all three structural parameters were linearly correlated with iAUC and Ktrans. For iAUC, structural parameters also modified each other's effect.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MR imaging biomarkers of vascular function are linked to structural changes in tumor vessels and that antiangiogenic therapy can affect this link. Our work also demonstrates the feasibility of three-dimensional functional–structural validation of MR biomarkers in vivo to improve their biological interpretation and clinical utility.

  abstract  = {Despite the significance of tumour neoangiogenesis and the extensive knowledge on the molecular basis of blood vessel formation currently no quantitative data exist on the 3D microvascular architecture in human primary tumours and their precursor lesions. This prompted us to examine the 3D vascular network of normal colon mucosa, adenomas and invasive carcinomas by means of quantitative microvascular corrosion casting. Fresh hemicolectomy specimens from 20 patients undergoing cancer or polyposis coli surgery were used for corrosion casting, factor VIII and VEGF immunostaining. In addition, immunostaining was done on colorectal tissue from 33 patients with metastatic and non-metastatic carcinomas, polyposis coli and adenomas. This first quantitative analysis of intervessel and interbranching distances, branching angles and vessel diameters in human cancer specimens revealed distinct patterns of the microvascular unit in the tumour centre and periphery. Irrespective of the tumour localization and grading all individual tumours displayed qualitatively and quantitatively the same vascular architecture. This gives further evidence for the existence of a tumour type-specific vascular architecture as recently demonstrated for experimental tumours. Metastatic tumours displayed different vascular architectures only within hot spots, in terms of smaller intervascular distances than in non-metastatic tumours. Pre-cancerous lesions have in part virtually the same vascular architecture like invasive carcinomas. Comparison of VEGF immunostaining also suggests that angiogenesis sets in long before the progress towards invasive phenotypes and that the so-called angiogenic switch is more likely a sequence of events. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign},

Several quantitative angiogenesis assays exist, each with its own unique characteristics and disadvantages. In this review we discuss some of the commonly used assays, their methodological pitfalls and current use. The corneal micropocket and the CAM assay are well established. However, the matrix-implant assays have the potential advantage of replicating the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, thus making them suitable for the study of tumour angiogenesis. The ideal quantitative angiogenesis assay does not exist and the use of two complimentary quantitative assays, such as a matrix implant assay and a microcirculatory preparation like the CAM or corneal micropocket assay, provides the best compromise. Newer models like the hollow-fibre assay are being developed and older ones refined. Assay systems should reflect distinct disease processes. Thus it is appropriate to develop assays that study exclusively pro- or anti-angiogenic compounds or anti-vascular agents. Criticisms of currently available screening systems are that the predictive value of current screening systems remains to be established as anti-angiogenic agents are still in clinical development. Anti-angiogenic agents are likely to be most effective as chronic therapy for remission maintenance in the metastatic setting or as adjuvant therapy in patients at high risk of relapse, an important clinical aspect not addressed in animal models of tumour angiogenesis. Histological analysis still provides the most detailed information on in vivo angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is a dynamic process and assays that permit continuous monitoring of the angiogenic response and provide information on the physiological characteristics of new vessels will be distinctly advantageous over older systems. The development of non-invasive techniques for quantitation of angiogenesis will greatly facilitate this process.},

By routine histology, numerous microscopic vascular abnormalities are also present. The structural expansion of capillaries and distinctive activated phenotype of lesional endothelial cells are believed not only to be clinical and pathologic hallmarks of the disease, but to play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic plaques. Despite over 20 years of research by leading angiogenesis experts and numerous studies, many details regarding the cellular and molecular basis for angiogenesis in psoriasis remain unknown. In this review, 10 different sections are presented to update recent progress in this active field of investigative skin biology. Highlights of this review include the phenotypic characterization of endothelial cells in acute and chronic psoriatic plaques, and a review of a novel animal model of psoriasis using human skin engrafted onto severe combined immunodeficient mice followed by injection of activated immunocytes. This new experimental model represents a reproducible and pharmacologically validated method to trigger neovascularization and bona fide psoriatic plaque formation. In addition, the potential contribution of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal macrophages to the angiogenic tissue reaction is presented, and a series of questions are then posed that can be answered using the severe combined immunodeficient mouse model of psoriasis. Finally, a model is proposed integrating all available data into a coherent multistep reaction schema that includes active participation by multiple cell types including natural killer T cells, keratinocytes, macrophages, and microvascular endothelial cells.},

Recent findingsExperimental data extends beyond the tip cell vs. stalk cell paradigm, and involves numerous molecular inputs such as vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch. This data is being used to generate and validate computational models, which can then be used to predict the results of hypothetical experiments that are difficult to perform in the laboratory, and to generate new hypotheses that account for system-wide interactions. As a result of this integration, descriptions of critical gradients of growth factor–receptor complexes have been generated, and new modulators of cell behavior have been described.

  abstract   = {Over the past 40 years, there has been a strong focus on the development of mathematical models of angiogenesis, while developmental remodelling has received little such attention from the mathematical community. Sprouting angiogenesis can be seen as a very crude way of laying out a primitive vessel network (the raw material), while remodelling (understood as pruning of redundant vessels, diameter control, and the establishment of vessel identity and hierarchy) is the key to turning that primitive network into a functional network. This multiscale problem is of prime importance in the development of a functional vasculature. In addition, defective remodelling (either during developmental remodelling or due to a reactivation of the remodelling programme caused by an injury) is associated with a significant number of diseases. In this review, we discuss existing mathematical models of developmental remodelling and explore the important contributions that these models have made to the field of vascular development. These mathematical models are effectively used to investigate and predict vascular development and are able to reproduce experimentally observable results. Moreover, these models provide a useful means of hypothesis generation and can explain the underlying mechanisms driving the observed structural and functional network development. However, developmental vascular remodelling is still a relatively new area in mathematical biology, and many biological questions remain unanswered. In this review, we present the existing modelling paradigms and define the key challenges for the field.},

It is an essential process in the formation and development of blood vessels, so it is supportive in healing of wound while its inhibition may help to restrict the size of tumor. To quantify the effect of an agent on angiogenesis, a standardized preclinical screening assay is necessary. The objective of this review is to document all the methods of angiogenesis assessment and specific techniques to quantify the results, majorly focusing on the modes of calculation and concerns that researchers need to make before reaching to any conclusion. Scientific research on angiogenesis relies on different models for assessment, including in vitro, in vivo and in ovo models. Many of these assays are practiced to test the effect of both pro and anti angiogenic agents. The ﬁndings articulated in this study will help to provide better visions into the pathophysiology of diseases associated with angiogenesis and to establish new as well as appropriate angiogenic or anti angiogenic treatment strategies for the future. Nevertheless, angiogenesis is a vigorous process and the techniques to evaluate this process with thorough assessment of physiological characteristics of new blood vessels will be advantageous over the older systems of angiogenesis assessment methods.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is required for many pathologic processes, including invasive tumor growth as well as physiologic organ/tissue maintenance. Angiogenesis during development and adulthood is likely regulated by a balance between endogenous proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. It is speculated that tumor growth requires disruption of such balance; thus, the angiogenic switch must be turned "on" for cancer progression. If the angiogenic switch needs to be turned on to facilitate the tumor growth, the question remains as to what the physiologic status of this switch is in the adult human body; is it "off," with inhibitors outweighing the stimulators, or maintained at a fine "balance," keeping the proangiogenic properties of many factors at a delicate "activity" balance with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. The physiologic status of this balance is important to understand as it might determine an individual's predisposition to turn the switch on during pathologic events dependent on angiogenesis. Conceivably, if the physiologic angiogenesis balance in human population exists somewhere between off and even balance, an individual's capacity and rate to turn the switch on might reflect their normal physiologic angiogenic status. In this regard, although extensive knowledge has been gained in our understanding of endogenous growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis, the activities associated with endogenous inhibitors are poorly understood. In this review, we will present an overview of the knowledge gained in studies related to the identification and characterization of 27 different endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial cell migration, and organize themselves into a branched, connected network. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout-tips permits further extension of the capillaries and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumours. In this article we first of all present a review of a variety of mathematical models which have been used to describe the formation of capillary networks and then focus on a specific recent model which uses novel mathematical modelling techniques to generate both two- and three-dimensional vascular structures. The modelling focusses on key events of angiogenesis such as the migratory response of endothelial cells to exogenous cytokines (tumour angiogenic factors, TAF) secreted by a solid tumour; endothelial cell proliferation; endothelial cell interactions with extracellular matrix macromolecules such as fibronectin; capillary sprout branching and anastomosis. Numerical simulations of the model, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and the theoretical structures generated by the model are compared with the morphology of actual capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments. A final conclusions section discusses the use of the mathematical model as a possible angiogenesis assay.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, a number of mathematical and computational models have been developed to study different aspects of angiogenesis that span the spatial and temporal scales encompassed by this complex process. For example, models have been built to investigate how growth factors and receptors signal endothelial cell proliferation, how groups of endothelial cells assemble into individual vessels, and how tumors recruit the ingrowth of whole microvascular networks. A prudent question to pose is: “what have we learned from these models?” This review aims to answer this question as it pertains to angiogenesis in the context of normal physiological growth, tumorigenesis, wound healing, tissue engineering, and the design of therapeutic strategies. We also provide a framework for parsing angiogenesis models into categories, according to the type of modeling approach used, the spatial and temporal scales simulated, and the overarching question being posed to the model. Finally, this review introduces some of the simplification strategies and assumptions used in model building, discusses model validation, and makes recommendations for application of modeling approaches to unresolved questions in the field.},

  abstract   = {Angiogenesis, the growth of a network of blood vessels, is a crucial component of solid tumour growth, linking the relatively harmless avascular growth phase and the potentially fatal vascular growth phase. As a process, angiogenesis is a well-orchestrated sequence of events involving endothelial cell migration, proliferation; degradation of tissue; new capillary vessel (sprout) formation; loop formation (anastomosis) and, crucially, blood flow through the network. Once there is blood flow associated with the nascent network, the subsequent growth of the network evolves both temporally and spatially in response to the combined effects of angiogenic factors, migratory cues via the extracellular matrix and perfusion-related haemodynamic forces in a manner that may be described as both adaptive and dynamic. In this paper we present a mathematical model which simultaneously couples vessel growth with blood flow through the vessels--dynamic adaptive tumour-induced angiogenesis (DATIA). This new mathematical model presents a theoretical and computational investigation of the process and highlights a number of important new targets for therapeutic intervention. In contrast to earlier flow models, where the effects of perfusion (blood flow) were essentially evaluated a posteriori, i.e. after generating a hollow network, blood flow in the model described in this paper has a direct impact during capillary growth, with radial adaptations and network remodelling occurring as immediate consequences of primary anastomoses. Capillary network architectures resulting from the dynamically adaptive model are found to differ radically from those obtained using earlier models. The DATIA model is used to examine the effects of changing various physical and biological model parameters on the developing vascular architecture and the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumour. Subsequent simulations of chemotherapeutic treatments under different parameter regimes lead to the identification of a number of new therapeutic targets for tumour management.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years, numerous research groups have attempted to provide mathematical descriptions of the skin wound healing process. The development of theoretical models of the interlinked processes that underlie the healing mechanism has yielded considerable insight into aspects of this critical phenomenon that remain difficult to investigate empirically. In particular, the mathematical modeling of angiogenesis, i.e., capillary sprout growth, has offered new paradigms for the understanding of this highly complex and crucial step in the healing pathway. With the recent advances in imaging and cell tracking, the time is now ripe for an appraisal of the utility and importance of mathematical modeling in wound healing angiogenesis research. The purpose of this review is to pedagogically elucidate the conceptual principles that have underpinned the development of mathematical descriptions of wound healing angiogenesis, specifically those that have utilized a continuum reaction-transport framework, and highlight the contribution that such models have made toward the advancement of research in this field. We aim to draw attention to the common assumptions made when developing models of this nature, thereby bringing into focus the advantages and limitations of this approach. A deeper integration of mathematical modeling techniques into the practice of wound healing angiogenesis research promises new perspectives for advancing our knowledge in this area. To this end we detail several open problems related to the understanding of wound healing angiogenesis, and outline how these issues could be addressed through closer cross-disciplinary collaboration.},

  abstract = {Computational models of cancer complement the biological study of tumor growth. However, existing modeling approaches can be both inefficient and inaccurate due to the difficulties of representing the complex interactions between cells and tissues. We present a three-dimensional multiscale agent-based model of tumor growth with angiogenesis. The model is designed to easily adapt to various cancer types, although we focus on breast cancer. It includes cellular (genetic control), tissue (cells, blood vessels, angiogenesis), and molecular (VEGF, diffusion) levels of representation. Unlike in most cancer models, both normally functioning tissue cells and tumor cells are included in the model. Tumors grow following the expected spheroid cluster pattern, with growth limited by available oxygen. Angiogenesis, the process by which tumors may encourage new vessel growth for nutrient diffusion, is modeled with a new discrete approach that we propose will decrease computational cost. Our results show that despite proposing these new abstractions, we see similar results to previously accepted angiogenesis models. This may indicate that a more discrete approach should be considered by modelers in the future.},

Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models.

However, efforts to model these systems often rely on either purely stochastic or purely rule-based methods. To better understand the balance between stochasticity and determinism in biological processes a computational approach that incorporates both influences may afford additional insight into underlying biological mechanisms that give rise to emergent system properties. We apply a combined approach to the simulation and study of angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from existing networks. This complex multicellular process begins with selection of an initiating endothelial cell, or tip cell, which sprouts from the parent vessels in response to stimulation by exogenous cues. We have constructed an agent-based model of sprouting angiogenesis to evaluate endothelial cell sprout initiation frequency and location, and we have experimentally validated it using high-resolution time-lapse confocal microscopy. ABM simulations were then compared to a Monte Carlo model, revealing that purely stochastic simulations could not generate sprout locations as accurately as the rule-informed agent-based model. These findings support the use of rule-based approaches for modeling the complex mechanisms underlying sprouting angiogenesis over purely stochastic methods.},

Numerical simulations show: 1), different tumor-secreted pro-angiogenic factor gradient profiles dramatically affect capillary sprout morphology; 2), average sprout extension speeds depend on the proximity of the proliferating region to the sprout tip, and the coordination of cellular functions; and 3), inhomogeneities in the extravascular tissue lead to sprout branching and anastomosis, phenomena that emerge without any prescribed rules.

The model comprises 108 arterial segments, with 64 main arteries and 44 perforator arteries, with lumen radii ranging from 0.24 cm - axillary artery- to 0.018 cm - perforator arteries. The modeling of blood flow in deformable vessels is governed by a well-known set of hyperbolic partial differential equations that accounts for mass and momentum conservation and a constitutive equation for the arterial wall. The variational formulation used to solve the problem and the related numerical approach are described. The model rendered consistent pressure and flow rate outputs when compared with patient records already published in the literature. In addition, an application to dimensionally-heterogeneous modeling is presented in which the developed arterial network is employed as an underlying model for a three-dimensional geometry of a branching point to be embedded in order to perform local analyses.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is the process through which new blood vessels are formed from preexisting ones and plays a critical role in several conditions including embryonic development, tissue repair and disease. Moreover, enhanced therapeutic angiogenesis is a major goal in the field of regenerative medicine and efficient vascularization of artificial tissues and organs is one of the main hindrances in the implementation of tissue engineering approaches, while, on the other hand, inhibition of angiogenesis is a key therapeutic target to inhibit for instance tumor growth. During the last decades, the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process has been matter of intense research. In this regard, several in vitro and in vivo models have been established to visualize and study migration of endothelial progenitor cells, formation of endothelial tubules and the generation of new vascular networks, while assessing the conditions and treatments that either promote or inhibit such processes. In this review, we address and compare the most commonly used experimental models to study angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we focus on the implementation of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to study angiogenesis and discuss the advantages and not yet explored possibilities of its use as model organism.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is the generation of mature vascular networks from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is crucial during the organism' development, for wound healing and for the female reproductive cycle. Several murine experimental systems are well suited for studying developmental and pathological angiogenesis. They include the embryonic hindbrain, the post-natal retina and allantois explants. In these systems vascular networks are visualised by appropriate staining procedures followed by microscopical analysis. Nevertheless, quantitative assessment of angiogenesis is hampered by the lack of readily available, standardized metrics and software analysis tools. Non-automated protocols are being used widely and they are, in general, time - and labour intensive, prone to human error and do not permit computation of complex spatial metrics. We have developed a light-weight, user friendly software, AngioTool, which allows for quick, hands-off and reproducible quantification of vascular networks in microscopic images. AngioTool computes several morphological and spatial parameters including the area covered by a vascular network, the number of vessels, vessel length, vascular density and lacunarity. In addition, AngioTool calculates the so-called “branching index” (branch points / unit area), providing a measurement of the sprouting activity of a specimen of interest. We have validated AngioTool using images of embryonic murine hindbrains, post-natal retinas and allantois explants. AngioTool is open source and can be downloaded free of charge.},

This is coordinated through a dynamic, multi-directional cellular interplay between vascular, neuronal, and glial cells. Molecular exchanges across the blood–brain barrier or the close matching of regional blood flow with brain activation are not uniformly assigned to arteries, capillaries, and veins. Evidence has supported functional segmentation of the brain vasculature. This is achieved in part through morphologic or transcriptional heterogeneity of brain vascular cells—including endothelium, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle. Advances with single cell genomic technologies have shown increasing cell complexity of the brain vasculature identifying previously unknown cell types and further subclassifying transcriptional diversity in cardinal vascular cell types. Cell-type specific molecular transitions or zonations have been identified. In this review, we summarize emerging evidence for the expanding vascular cell diversity in the brain and how this may provide a cellular basis for functional segmentation along the arterial-venous axis.},

  abstract   = {Tumour angiogenesis leads to the formation of blood vessels that are structurally and spatially heterogeneous. Poor blood perfusion, in conjunction with increased hypoxia and oxygen heterogeneity, impairs a tumour’s response to radiotherapy. The optimal strategy for enhancing tumour perfusion remains unclear, preventing its regular deployment in combination therapies. In this work, we first identify vascular architectural features that correlate with enhanced perfusion following radiotherapy, using in vivo imaging data from vascular tumours. Then, we present a novel computational model to determine the relationship between these architectural features and blood perfusion in silico. If perfusion is defined to be the proportion of vessels that support blood flow, we find that vascular networks with small mean diameters and large numbers of angiogenic sprouts show the largest increases in perfusion post-irradiation for both biological and synthetic tumours. We also identify cases where perfusion increases due to the pruning of hypoperfused vessels, rather than blood being rerouted. These results indicate the importance of considering network composition when determining the optimal irradiation strategy. In the future, we aim to use our findings to identify tumours that are good candidates for perfusion enhancement and to improve the efficacy of combination therapies.},

I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Gödel’s sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and may help explain why our physical laws appear so simple.

  abstract   = {By intracorneal implantation of tumors in the eyes of rabbits, the early neovascular response to solid tumor growth could be directly observed. Fragments of homologous tumors—Brown-Pearce epithelioma and V2 carcinoma—were implanted into the avascular corneal stroma of rabbits at various distances from the limbus. Tumor growth and neovascular response of llmbal vessels were studied by: 1) Slit Lamp Stereomicroscopy, 2) histologic examination, 3) filling of vasculature with colloidal carbon, and 4) autoradiography after exposure to 3Hthymidine. Centrally placed tumors spread as thin plates until they reached within 2.5 ± 0.5 mm of the limbus, when new vessels began to grow from the limbal plexus toward the tumor edge. When tumors became vascularized, they grew rapidly into exophytic masses. Peripherally placed tumors evoked early neovascularization. The prevascular growth of incompatible rabbit homograft and mouse xenograft tumors suggested that the cornea, before its vascularization, was an immunologically privileged site for tumor growth. Intracorneal polyacrylamide gel implants containing tumor extracts elicited a specific pattern of corneal vascularization not observed with nonmalignant cell extracts. These experiments provide a new model for study of tumor growth and neovascularization in a site where there is anatomic separation of tumor cell stimulus from host vascular response; the technique of corneal gel implantation may be useful in the characterization of mediators of neovascularization.},

  abstract = {Trophoblast cells of the placenta in many species have acquired mechanisms to invade the uterus, inclusive of its blood vessels, to establish efficient fetomaternal exchange of molecules. This invasion is strictly controlled both spatially and temporally and, in humans, usually continues until midgestation. Key mechanisms underlying various steps in trophoblast invasion are: (i) the attachment to the basement membrane, most likely by binding to laminin; (ii) the detachment from the basement membrane matrix, a process requiring the presence of complex-type oligosaccharides on the cell surface; and (iii) the breakdown of basement membrane components, mediated by secretion of metalloproteases (such as type IV collagenases) and serine proteases (plasminogen activator). Activation of trophoblast-derived metalloproteases appears to be plasmin dependent. Trophoblast invasiveness in situ is controlled by the microenvironment, owing to local production of anti-invasive factors by the decidual tissue of the uterus. One of these factors is TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases), which neutralizes metalloproteases in an equimolar ratio. Another is TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta), which has a dual effect: it induces TIMP-1 secretion by the trophoblast and decidual cells and promotes differentiation of invasive trophoblast cells into multinucleated giant cells, which are presumably noninvasive. Thus, TGF-beta provides the key control of trophoblast invasiveness in situ. This control is lost in certain choriocarcinomas. In contrast to the response shown by the normal trophoblast, JAR and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell invasiveness does not seem to be inhibited by TGF-beta. In fact, in preliminary studies, JAR cells responded to TGF-beta by increased invasiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that tumors are angiogenesis dependent has, in the past decade, generated new investigations designed to elucidate the mechanism of angiogenesis itself. Many laboratories are now engaged in this pursuit. Some are studying angiogenesis that occurs in physiological situations, whereas others are interested in angiogenesis that dominates pathological conditions. These efforts have led to (1) the development of bioassays for angiogenesis; (2) the partial purification and, in one case, the complete purification of angiogenic factors from neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells; (3) the development of new polymer technology for the sustained release of these factors and other macromolecules in vivo; (4) the cloning and long-term culture of capillary endothelial cells; (5) the demonstration of the role of nonendothelial cells, such as mast cells in modulating angiogenesis; (6) the discovery of angiogenesis inhibitors; and (7) the demonstration that certain animal tumors will regress when angiogenesis is inhibited. The effects of angiogenesis inhibitors provide perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth. It is conceivable that the original effort to understand the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth will also lead to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors as a new class of pharmacologic agents in a variety of non-neoplastic diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis, and ocular neovascularization. However, much work remains to be done before it will be possible to understand (1) the regulatory systems that govern capillary density in normal tissues; (2) the factors that maintain the viability of microvascular endothelium; (3) the development of the vascular system itself; and (4) the mechanism by which vascular regression occurs, both in the embryo and in the postnatal organism. A knowledge of the mechanisms which underlie these normal processes may help to enlarge our comprehension of tumor angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Within the past 2 years, several angiogenic factors have been fully purified, their amino acid sequences determined, and their genes cloned. These polypeptides include acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor, angiogenin, and transforming growth factors alpha and beta. Other less well characterized angiogenesis factors have also been isolated, some of which are lipids. This article traces the discovery of the angiogenic factors and describes their possible significance in understanding growth regulation of the vascular system. When evaluated according to their putative targets, they appear to fall into two groups: those that act directly on vascular endothelial cells to stimulate locomotion or mitosis, and those that act indirectly by mobilizing host cells (for example, macrophages) to release endothelial growth factors. In addition to their presence in tumors undergoing neovascularization, the same angiogenic peptides are found in many normal tissues where neovascularization is not occurring. This suggests that physiological expression of angiogenic factors is tightly regulated. In addition to the persistent angiogenesis induced by tumors, it now appears that a variety of nonneoplastic diseases, previously thought to be unrelated, can be considered as "angiogenic diseases" because they are dominated by the pathologic growth of capillary blood vessels.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer, but the factors that control angiogenesis in vivo are not well defined. Multiple angiogenic polypeptides are known, and we have determined the expression of seven of these in primary human breast cancers; the relationship of expression to estrogen receptor and vascular density was also examined. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its four isoforms (121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, pleiotrophin, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), placental growth factor, and thymidine phosphorylase (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) were quantitated by RNase protection analysis. beta-FGF was also measured by ELISA. The estrogen receptor (ER), epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular density were analyzed in 64 primary breast cancers. All tumors expressed at least six different vascular growth factors. VEGF was most abundant, and the transcript for the 121-amino acid form predominated. Other angiogenic factors expressed at high levels were thymidine phosphorylase and TGF-beta1. Expression of most of the angiogenic factors did not correlate with that of ER or vascular density. However, thymidine phosphorylase did, with a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (P = 0.03). There were significant associations of pleiotrophin with acidic FGF expression (P = 0.001) and TGF-beta with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor expression (P = 0.001). Thus, angiogenesis may involve a coordinate regulation of some vascular growth factors. High VEGF expression correlated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis (P = 0.03), as did ER and epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Basic FGF was also assessed by ELISA and was more highly expressed in tumors than normal breast tissues (median, 346 microg/ml cytosol; range, 54-1323 versus median, 149; range, 32-509; P = 0.01). Implications for therapy are that broad spectrum agents that block features common to these factors may be useful (e.g., antagonism of heparin-binding activity agents), because so many angiogenic factors are expressed. Inhibiting endothelial migration or agents directly toxic to endothelium would be of value in a combined approach to therapy.},

The expression of VEGF, the closely related placental growth factor (PIGF), the newly cloned endothelial high affinity VEGF receptors KDR and FLT1, and the endothelial orphan receptors FLT4 and Tie were analyzed by in situ hybridization in normal human brain tissue and in the following CNS tumors: gliomas, grades II, III, IV; meningiomas, grades I and II; and melanoma metastases to the cerebrum. VEGF mRNA was up-regulated in the majority of low grade tumors studied and was highly expressed in cells of malignant gliomas. Significantly elevated levels of Tie, KDR, and FLT1 mRNAs, but not FLT4 mRNA, were observed in malignant tumor endothelia, as well as in endothelia of tissues directly adjacent to the tumor margin. In comparison, there was little or no receptor expression in normal brain vasculature. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that these endothelial receptors are induced during tumor progression and may play a role in tumor angiogenesis.},

Ligand cross-linking, ligand blotting, and uPA-Sepharose affinity chromatography revealed an increase in a cell surface uPA binding protein that corresponds to the uPAR on the basis of its affinity for uPA, M(r) of 50,000-55,000, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C sensitivity. By Scatchard analysis, VEGF increased the number of uPAR molecules by 2.8-3.5-fold and concomitantly decreased their affinity for uPA. By northern blotting uPAR mRNA was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to VEGF. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that VEGF-induced angiogenesis is accompanied by increased uPAR expression and uPA activity on the endothelial cell surface. These observations are consistent with the notion that the uPA-uPAR interaction facilitates cellular invasion.},

Mouse embryos homozygous for a targeted mutation in the flt-1 locus, flt-1lcz, formed endothelial cells in both embryonic and extra-embryonic regions, but assembled these cells into abnormal vascular channels and died in utero at mid-somite stages.

By measuring thymidine uptake, we found that TNF-alpha blocked a 2.3-fold increase in DNA synthesis induced by VEGF in human endothelial cells. To explore the possibility that the two interact to regulate endothelial cell proliferation, we examined the effect of TNF-alpha on VEGF receptor expression. In venous and arterial endothelial cells, TNF-alpha potently reduced mRNA transcripts of the two VEGF receptors (KDR/flk-1 and flt-1) in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. TNF-alpha at 1 ng/ml induced maximal inhibition of mRNA expression, which fell by approximately 70\% after 24 h. TNF-alpha treatment did not significantly affect the KDR/flk-1 half-life but did decrease its rate of transcription to 40\% of control. The decrease in KDR/flk-1 mRNA depended partially on new protein synthesis and was abolished by phorbol ester pretreatment. TNF-alpha decreased the amount of 35S-labeled KDR/flk-1 immunoprecipitated by an antibody specific for KDR/flk-1 to 18\% of control. We conclude that TNF-alpha downregulates expression of both VEGF receptors in human endothelial cells and that this effect is transcriptional (at least for KDR/flk-1). These data support the hypothesis that TNF-alpha exerts its antiangiogenic effect in part by modulating the VEGF-specific angiogenic pathway.},

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mitogenic action is mediated through a cell surface receptor (KDR/flk-1) whose expression is restricted primarily to endothelial cells in vivo. We determined DNA elements in the upstream untranslated region (UTR) of the human KDR gene which confer endothelial-specific expression. Methods. A 100kb genomic fragment encompassing the KDR gene was obtained by PI phage cloning and 4 KB of the KDR UTR was subcloned into a luciferase reporter gene expression plasmid. Deletion and site specific mutagenesis was performed. The gene constructs were transiently transfected into bovine retinal endotheiial cells (BREC), pericytes (RFC), and pigment epithelial cells (RPE) using lipofectamine. Promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. DNA binding proteins were identified in nuclear extracts using gel mobility shift assays. Results. Transfection of BREC with wild-type KDR promoter resulted in a 407fold increase in activity over promoterless control, an effect 5 & 14 times greater than in RFC & RPE, respectively. Stimulation as a percent of maximally driven promoter expression in each cell type was 46% for BRE but only 6% for RPC and 3% for RPE. Gel mobility shift assays identified a 50 bp element which bound transcription factor(s) produced by BREC but not RPC or RPE cells. Site-specific mutagenesis of this region localized specific DNA binding to a 12 base pair region, containing 3 essential residues. Mutations in this region reduced luciferase expression over 65% in BRE, with little effect in either RPC or RPE. Conclusions. These data identify a 12 base pair DNA element which binds a nuclear factor preferentially produced in endothelial cells that confers endothelial-selective expression.},

  abstract = {The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) expressed on the surface of endothelial cells are likely to play key roles in initiating the program of endothelial cell growth during development and subsequent vascularization during wound healing and tumorigenesis. Expression of the Tek RTK during mouse development is restricted primarily to endothelial cells and their progenitors, the angioblasts, suggesting that Tek is a key participant in vasculogenesis. To investigate the role that Tek plays within the endothelial cell lineage, we have disrupted the Tek signaling pathway using two different genetic approaches. First, we constructed transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of the Tek receptor. Second, we created a null allele of the tek gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative alleles of Tek or homozygous for a null allele of the tek locus both died in utero with similar defects in the integrity of their endothelium. By crossing transgenic mice that express the lacZ reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the endothelial cell-specific tek promoter, we found that the extraembryonic and embryonic vasculature was patterned correctly. However, homozygous tek embryos had approximately 30\% and 75\% fewer endothelial cells at day 8.5 and 9.0, respectively. Homozygous null embryos also displayed abnormalities in heart development, consistent with the conclusion that Tek is necessary for endocardial/myocardial interactions during development.

  abstract = {Tie-1 and Tie-2 define a new class of receptor tyrosine kinases that are specifically expressed in developing vascular endothelial cells. To study the functions of Tie-1 and Tie-2 during vascular endothelial cell growth and differentiation in vivo, targeted mutations of the genes in mice were introduced by homologous recombination. Embryos deficient in Tie-1 failed to establish structural integrity of vascular endothelial cells, resulting in oedema and subsequently localized haemorrhage. However, analyses of embryos deficient in Tie-2 showed that it is important in angiogenesis, particularly for vascular network formation in endothelial cells. This result contrasts with previous reports on Tie-2 function in vasculogenesis and/or endothelial cell survival. Our in vivo analyses indicate that the structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases Tie-1 and Tie-2 have important but distinct roles in the formation of blood vessels.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of endothelial cells during microvascular growth were studied using a model of inflammation-induced neovascularization of the rat cornea. Inflammation was produced by central silver nitrate cauterization, cellular proliferation was assessed by tritiated-thymidine autoradiography and nuclear counts on plastic sections, and formation of new vessels was studied on whole-mount preparations after vascular perfusion with colloidal carbon. The 3H-thymidine-labeling index of endothelial cells was significantly higher than normal at 1 day following cauterization, although neither mitotic figures nor vascular sprouts were present. The labeling index reached a peak at 2 days, when cell division was evidenced by mitotic figures and doubling of the number of nuclei per section. Actual vascular sprouting also began during the 1- to 2-day interval. To determine whether vascular sprouting was dependent upon endothelial cell division, proliferation was suppressed by X-irradiation (2000 or 8000 rads) prior to cauterization. In irradiated corneas displaying no cellular proliferation, vascular sprouting at 2 days was similar to that in contralateral shielded corneas. Vascular growth continued in irradiated corneas between 2 and 4 days, but at 4 days the length of the vascular ingrowth was reduced to 66.7 and 53.4\% of control after 2000 and 8000 rads, respectively. Vascular ingrowth did not progress between 4 and 7 days. This study demonstrates that initial vascular sprouting does not require proliferation of endothelial cells, although under ordinary circumstances DNA synthesis has been stimulated and is in progress at the time of sprouting. After initial sprouting without proliferation, limited vascular growth can continue for about 2 more days but subsequently ceases. Ultrastructural evaluation suggested that migration and redistribution of existing endothelial cells from the limbal vessels enable vascular sprouting and elongation without cellular proliferation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, tumor-related angiogenesis has become an important field of research in oncology. It could be stated that growth of solid tumors is completely dependent on neovascularization to provide the tumor with all required nutrients. Special compounds (tumor angiogenesis factor[s]) are released by tumor cells into the environment to stimulate different types of normal cells to become active for the tumor. In particular, endothelial cells of neighboring capillaries are induced to react. They disintegrate their own basal lamina, detach from their neighbors, enter the extracellular matrix, and migrate toward the tumor mass. Cell divisions occur within such sprouts, thereby increasing the number of migrating endothelial cells. Strands of such cells are formed, and inter- and intracellular lumina develop. Loops of these hollow strands anastomose to form a network of new vessels which become connected with the blood circulation. The tumor mass thus becomes vascularized and can continue to grow. The prevention of neoangiogenesis has an enormous impact on cancer treatment by inhibiting the growth of the tumor. In this review, all important aspects of tumor-related angiogenesis are presented.},

  abstract = {Migration of microvessel endothelial cells (MEC) in response to angiogenic stimuli is a key aspect of angiogenesis, whether in physiologic or pathologic situations. In this work, we provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of the chemokinetic and chemotactic responses of human MEC to acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). A uniform concentration of 1 micrograms/ml of heparin was included in most experiments to exploit heparin's potentiating effect on aFGF activity. The migration is measured in an under-agarose assay with a linear geometry, and evaluated in terms of the random motility and chemotaxis coefficients, mu and chi, which are defined in a mathematical model. The change in value of mu with changes in aFGF concentration provides a quantitative description of the stimulated random motility response, a process known as chemokinesis. This allows the true directional response in gradients to be quantified by the chemotaxis coefficient, chi, and its variation with attractant concentration. The effect of aFGF on MEC random motility is relatively small, with the random motility coefficient ranging from 4.6 +/- 0.4 x 10(-9) to 9.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9) cm2/second (mean +/- SE) over four orders of magnitude of aFGF concentration (10(-11) to 10(-8) M). On the other hand, the magnitude of the chemotaxis coefficient at optimal concentrations is quite large (2600 +/- 750 cm2/second-M around 10(-10) M aFGF), demonstrating a significant degree of MEC directional sensitivity to aFGF gradients. The chemotaxis coefficient shows a biphasic dependence on aFGF concentration, suggestive of a receptor-mediated response in which apparent differences in receptor occupancy govern directional bias. These results provide support for the hypothesis that MEC chemotaxis accounts for the directed microvessel growth observed in angiogenesis.},

  abstract   = {1. The process of healing in the rabbit ear chamber has been investigated in detail by correlating light microscopy, mainly in vivo, and electron microscopy. 2. During healing new vessels are formed from existing vessels by a process of sprouting and anastomosis, with subsequent remodelling of the loops so formed. 3. The fundamental process in the formation of vessels by sprouting is the mitotic division of existing endothelium, during which it retains its characteristic properties. 4. Blood vessel sprouts are composed of strands of tightly apposed cells formed in continuity with the walls of existing vessels. The subsequent canalization of such strands takes place extracellularly by a series of events largely as described by Billroth (1856). 5. The endothelium of recently formed vessels has a fine structure which distinguishes it clearly from that of more mature vessels. Certain features of this structure are compatible with a secretory activity by the endothelium during the formation of new vessels. 6. Evidence was obtained that in the course of differentiation of recently formed vessels fibroblast-like cells are incorporated into vessel walls to become adventitial cells, and that adventitial cells may undergo conversion to vascular smooth muscle cells. 7. Lymphatic endothelium exhibits properties during regeneration that confirm the specificity of this form of endothelium. 8. Cells with the characteristic fine structure of fibroblasts were frequently found in mitosis. The fibroblasts in the regions of active fibrogenesis had a highly developed cisternal form of endoplasmic reticulum. Vesicles and corresponding caveolae identifiable in such fibroblasts may provide a communication between the endoplasmic reticulum and the sites of fibrogenesis at the external surfaces of the cells. 9. Cells sharing characteristic features of fine structure formed a series which grouped together the monocyte, macrophage and foreign body giant cell. 10. Highly fibrillary intracytoplasmic tracts were found in both fibroblasts and macrophages. These tracts were equated with the fibroglial fibres of light microscopy. 11. 'Clear spaces' in advance of the growing fringe of blood vessels were temporary structures lined by a pavement of mesothelium-like cells. 12. No evidence was found of the formation of primitive mesenchymal tissue during healing in the mammal.},

  abstract = {Plasma fibronectin is probably the major nonimmune particulate opsonin in blood and is cross-linked to fibrin during the final stage of blood coagulation. Fibronectin also occurs in an insoluble form in basement membranes especially those underlying endothelial cells and in loose connective tissue. Fibronectin was demonstrated in cultured human endothelial cells and in the surrounding extracellular matrix by immunofluorescence microscopy by using antibody to human plasma fibronectin. Cultured human endothelial cells released fibronectin into the culture medium which was immunologically identical to the fibronectin in human plasma. Cultured human endothelial cells were labeled with [3H] leucine. The radioactive fibronectin present in the endothelial postculture medium and in urea extracts of cellular monolayers was isolated with either anti-fibronectin coupled to Protein A-Sepharose or double antibody immunoprecipitation and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When reduced, the [3H] fibronectin synthesized by cultured endothelial cells had the same mol wt (approximately 200,000) as plasma fibronectin. Unreduced, the [3H] fibronectin synthesized by endothelial cells migrated as a dimer, as did plasma fibronectin. Fibronectin accounted for approximately 15\% of the protein synthesized and released by endothelial cells into the culture medium. Thus, cultured endothelial cells synthesize fibronectin, secrete it into the culture medium, and incorporate it into extracellular matrix. The results suggest that the endothelial cell is potentially a major site of synthesis of circulating plasma fibronectin. In addition, fibronectin derived from endothelial cells may be an important structural component of the subendothelium.},

In normal glomeruli, HSPG was predominantly localized in the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium, and to minor extent in the basement membranes of tubules and Bowman's capsule. Collagen IV and laminin were distributed in glomerular basement membrane and mesangium in minor amounts. Interstitial collagens usually do not occur within glomeruli except for collagen V which has a light microscopic glomerular distribution similar to collagen IV. In diabetic diffuse glomerulosclerosis, the enlarged mesangial matrix showed an increased staining reaction for collagen IV, V, laminin, and fibronectin whereas the staining pattern of HSPG was markedly reduced. Early, small nodular lesions in diabetic glomeruli were similarly positive for most of the basement membrane components, whereas HSPG remained absent. With an increase in the diameter of the noduli, however, the staining reaction for all basement membrane components diminished, whereas interstitial collagens V and III, but not collagen I, were present in these noduli in substantial amounts. These initial studies provide evidence that the changes in the glomerular matrix in diabetic nephropathy may be divided into distinct and progressing stages of lesions. The reduced amount of HSPG even in slight, early lesions may represent the morphologic correlate to the impaired filter function of the glomerular basement membrane.},

Similarly, their apical cell surface is, as in vivo, nonthrombogenic. In contrast, when the cultures are maintained in the absence of FGF, the cells undergo within two to three passages structural and functional alterations that are incompatible with their in vivo morphological appearance and physiological function. Cultures maintained in the absence of FGF no longer adopt, upon reaching confluence, the configuration of a monolayer composed of small closely apposed and nonoverlapping, cuboidal cells. Instead, confluent cultures deprived of FGF consist of large, overlapping cells which have lost the polarity of cell surface characteristic of the vascular endothelium. The apical cell surface becomes thrombogenic, as reflected by its ability to bind platelets, whereas fibronectin, which at confluence is normally associated only with the basal cell surface, can be found both on top of and underneath the cell layer. Among other changes, both sparse and confluent cultures maintained in the absence of FGF showed a greatly increased production of fibronectin. CSP-60, a cell surface protein whose appearance is correlative with the adoption of a cell monolayer configuration, can no longer be detected in cultures maintained in the absence of FGF. Overlapping endothelial cells maintained in the absence of FGF can also no longer function as a protective barrier against the uptake of ligands such as low density lipoprotein. Exposure of the culture to FGF induces a restoration of the normal endothelial characteristics concomitant with the adoption of a flattened cell monolayer morphology. These results demonstrate that, in addition to being a mitogen. FGF is involved in controlling the differentiation and phenotypic expression of the vascular endothelium. This is reflected by its effect on the morphological appearance, polarity of cell surfaces, platelet binding capacity, and barrier function of the vascular endothelium.},

We investigated the relationship between PMN migration and the ECM molecule fibronectin (FN). We used an in vitro migration assay system to show that human PMNs migrated across an FN-coated filter barrier toward a formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) chemoattractant gradient in greater numbers than across (uncoated) bare fitters. In 1 h of fMLP stimulation, 69 +/- 6\% of the PMNs had migrated across the FN-coated filters, whereas 46 +/- 5\% of PMNs migrated across bare filters. This effect was specific to FN; coating the filters with the ECM protein vitronectin did not enhance migration. Monoclonal antibodies against FN or against the alpha5 or beta1 integrin subunits of the FN receptor inhibited the enhanced PMN migration response across FN-coated filters. These findings indicate that the extracellular matrix protein FN enhances PMN migration and that this response is mediated by the alpha5beta1 FN receptor.},

  abstract = {The migration of tumor cells through basement membranes and extracellular matrices is an integral component of tumor invasion and metastasis. Laminin and fibronectin are two basement membrane- and extracellular matrix-associated noncollagenous glycoproteins that have been shown to promote both cell adhesion and motility. Purified preparations of laminin and fibronectin stimulated the directed migration of B16 murine metastatic melanoma cells in vitro as assessed in modified Boyden chambers. The stimulation of migration occurred over a concentration range of 1-100 micrograms/ml of laminin or fibronectin, with a peak response occurring between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml. The maximal response of these cells was 80-120-fold higher than control migration. Affinity-purified antibody preparations specifically abrogated the migration of these cells in response to the respective proteins. Tumor cells in suspension were preincubated in physiologic levels of plasma fibronectin prior to assay to partially mimic what occurs when a metastasizing cell is in the blood stream. This preincubation with plasma fibronectin had no effect on the subsequent migration of cells in response to either laminin or fibronectin. Furthermore, experiments using filters precoated with fibronectin or laminin indicated that these cells could migrate by haptotaxis to these two proteins. We conclude that tumor cell migration in response to such noncollagenous adhesive glycoproteins could be an important aspect in the invasion and metastasis of certain malignant cell types.},

The chemotactic response plateaued with time, paralleling the disappearance of the fibronectin concentration gradient in the chambers. As further evidence that chemotaxis was measured, we observed that cell migration did not occur when cells were incubated with fibronectin in the absence of a concentration gradient. Endothelial cell mitogens increased bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation in our experiments but did not stimulate chemotaxis above background levels. In contrast, fibronectin inhibited cell proliferation by 23\%. We present a hypothetical model of the role of fibronectin in evoking endothelial cell chemotaxis during tumor neovascularization.},

In this paper a mathematical model is presented which describes the migration of capillary sprouts in response to a chemoattractant field set up by a tumour-released angiogenic factor, sometimes termed a tumour angiogenesis factor (TAF). The resulting model admits travelling wave solutions which correspond either to successful neovascularization of the tumour or failure of the tumour to secure a vascular network, and which exhibit many of the characteristic features of angiogenesis. For example, the increasing speed of the vascular front, and the evolution of an increasingly developed vascular network behind the leading capillary tip front (the brush-border effect) are both discernible from the numerical simulations. Through the development and analysis of a simplified caricature model, valuable insight is gained into how the balance between chemotaxis, tip proliferation and tip death affects the tumour's ability to induce a vascular response from neighbouring blood vessels. In particular, it is possible to define the success of angiogenesis in terms of known parameters, thereby providing a potential framework for assessing the viability of tumour neovascularization in terms of measurable quantities.},

A mathematical model for the formation of the capillary buds is presented which focuses on the potential role that haptotaxis may play.

Tumour angiogenesis is initiated by the release of diffusible substances by the tumour, whereby neighbouring capillary vessels are stimulated to grow and eventually penetrate the tumour. Anti-angiogenesis has been proposed as a potential strategy for the treatment of cancer (Folkman, 1995, Nature Med. 1, 21-31; Harris et al., 1996, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 38, 97-108). In this paper, a mathematical model of the development of the tumour vasculature is presented. By suitable manipulation of the model parameters, we simulate various anti-angiogenesis strategies and we examine the roles that haptotaxis and chemotaxis may play during the growth of the neovasculature. The model is simulated in two space dimensions (on a square domain) so that it is, in theory, experimentally reproducible and any predictions of the model can therefore be tested.},

A model is proposed in which a few simple coupled biochemical reactions are able to generate such structures. Among undifferentiated cells, a local peak of differentiation-inducing substance (activator) is formed by autocatalysis and lateral inhibition. The activator peak triggers the differentiation of the cell at that location. Due to changes in metabolism, the differentiated cell repels the activator peak and drives it to a neighbouring cell which then also differentiates. The repulsion between the activator peak and the already differentiated cells forces the activator peak to move ahead of the tip of the extending filament. Long filaments of differentiated cells may be formed, which can split, branch laterally, reconnect with each other and grow towards specific target cells. Partial differential equations describing the mutual interaction of the substances involved were presented and solved with a computer. The resulting patterns show self-regulating properties and other features found in the leaf vascular system, the pattern of tracheae in insect epidermis, and other biological networks.},

  abstract = {The question of how spatial structures and order are generated in the developing organism is one of the most challenging areas of biological research today. Much useful work has been done, principally by observing pattern regulation occurring after an experimental disturbance, but the underlying mechanisms — the multiplicity of molecular, cellular and tissue interactions taking place still remain obscure. This book shows which types of molecular interaction are able to account for well known and representative results documented in the literature. The mechanisms proposed are illustrated by precise, yet simply understood mathematical models, a means profitably applied for illuminating complex systems in many other disciplines. 
The book begins by discussing mechanisms which have the ability to generate biological patterns, and goes on to consider how these mechanisms are used to generate positional information. A detailed comparison of the general theory with insect development is presented, and further chapters review the generation of subpatterns and how cells respond. Also considered are mechanisms for the activation of particular genes, which arc seen to be compatible with developmental alteration induced by a known class of mutants. The book concludes with a collection of FORTRAN computer programs which allow a simulation of the assumed interactions.
The precise mathematical treatment of biological dada presented here represents the first attempt to formulate a coherent theory of pattern formation during development. It will certainly stimulate further research, and will be read with interest by developmental biologists and those interested in mathematical modelling of complex systems.},

  abstract = {We review a number of biologically motivated cellular automata (CA) that arise in models of excitable and oscillatory media, in developmental biology, in neurobiology, and in population biology. We suggest technical and theoretical arguments that permit greater speed and enhanced realism, and apply these to several classical examples of pattern formation. We also describe CA that arise in models for fibroblast aggregation, branching networks, trail following, and neuronal maps.},
